Efficient Redundancy Allocation for Reliable Service Function Chains in Edge Computing,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4791/,"Nguyen, Thi-Thuy-LienPham, Tuan-MinhPham, Manh LinhDr. Mạnh Linh Phạm","Ensuring the high reliability of service function chains (SFCs) in Edge Computing, in which several distributed edge servers are available, is a challenging issue. Previous studies on reliable SFCs ignore the impact of physical hardware failures when multiple virtual network functions (VNFs) are deployed on the same server, resulting in inaccurate reliability estimates. In this paper, we first propose an optimization model and approximation algorithm, considering both hardware and software reliability, to maximize the reliability of SFCs in each service demand. We then develop an algorithm to increase the reliability of SFCs to a given requirement. The evaluation results show that our algorithms achieve a near-optimal solution with a significant reduction in the computational time for finding the placement of redundant VNFs. We also observe that our proposed redundancy VNF allocation can efficiently save the backup cost to achieve a given SFC reliability requirement.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

OPTIMUM SOUND PROPAGATION IN OCEAN: THE COMPARISON BETWEEN NORMAL MODE AND EMPIRICAL FRANCOIS-GARRISON FORMULA,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4804/,"Tran Cao, QuyenTráº§n Cao Quyá»�n","There are not only theory but also the empirical formula to deal with the problem of sound propagation in ocean. As such the Normal mode and Francois-Garrison are typical methods. Optimum sound propagation in ocean is the way we unify these two methods. In this paper, we investigate the transmission losses of both Normal mode and Francois-Garrison at some frequencies (170Hz, 800Hz, 100 KHz) at shallow water conditions (Tonkin gulf). The calculated and simulation results show that the optimum is achieved when the Normal mode is used at low frequencies whereas the Francois-Garrison is used at high frequencies.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Predicting land use effects on flood susceptibility using machine learning and remote sensing in coastal Vietnam,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4811/,"Vu, Van TichNguyen, Huu DuyVu, Phuong LanHa, Minh CuongBui, Van DongNguyen, Thi OanhHoang, Van HiepNguyen, Thanh Kim HuePhD Minh Cuong HA","Flood damage is becoming increasingly severe in the context of climate change and changes in land use. Assessing the effects of these changes on floods is important, to help decision-makers and local authorities understand the causes of worsening floods and propose appropriate measures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of climate and land use change on flood susceptibility in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam, using machine learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and remote sensing. The machine learning models used a flood inventory including 1,864 flood locations and 11 conditional factors in 2017 and 2021, as the input data. The predictive capacity of the proposed models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). Both proposed models were successful, with AUC values exceeding 0.95 in predicting the effects of climate and land use change on flood susceptibility. The RF model, with AUC = 0.98, outperformed the SVM model (AUC = 0.97). The areas most susceptible to flooding increased between 2017 and 2021 due to increased built-up area. The results of the study confirm machine learning's capacity to assess differences in flood susceptibility.",Article,wpt2023088,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4811/1/wpt2023088.pdf,Aerospace Engineering,2023
Neuromorphic Computing Principles and Organization,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4655/,"Abdallah, Abderazek BenDang, Nam KhanhKhanh N. Dang","his book focuses on neuromorphic computing principles and organization and how to build fault-tolerant scalable hardware for large and medium scale spiking neural networks with learning capabilities. In addition, the book describes in a comprehensive way the organization and how to design a spike-based neuromorphic system to perform network of spiking neurons communication, computing, and adaptive learning for emerging AI applications. The book begins with an overview of neuromorphic computing systems and explores the fundamental concepts of artificial neural networks. Next, we discuss artificial neurons and how they have evolved in their representation of biological neuronal dynamics. Afterward, we discuss implementing these neural networks in neuron models, storage technologies, inter-neuron communication networks, learning, and various design approaches. Then, comes the fundamental design principle to build an efficient neuromorphic system in hardware. The challenges that need to be solved toward building a spiking neural network architecture with many synapses are discussed. Learning in neuromorphic computing systems and the major emerging memory technologies that promise neuromorphic computing are then given. A particular chapter of this book is dedicated to the circuits and architectures used for communication in neuromorphic systems. In particular, the Network-on-Chip fabric is introduced for receiving and transmitting spikes following the Address Event Representation (AER) protocol and the memory accessing method. In addition, the interconnect design principle is covered to help understand the overall concept of on-chip and off-chip communication. Advanced on-chip interconnect technologies, including si-photonic three-dimensional interconnects and fault-tolerant routing algorithms, are also given. The book also covers the main threats of reliability and discusses several recovery methods for multicore neuromorphic systems. This is important for reliable processing in several embedded neuromorphic applications. A reconfigurable design approach that supports multiple target applications via dynamic reconfigurability, network topology independence, and network expandability is also described in the subsequent chapters. The book ends with a case study about a real hardware-software design of a reliable three-dimensional digital neuromorphic processor geared explicitly toward the 3D-ICs biological brain’s three-dimensional structure. The platform enables high integration density and slight spike delay of spiking networks and features a scalable design. We present methods for fault detection and recovery in a neuromorphic system as well. Neuromorphic Computing Principles and Organization is an excellent resource for researchers, scientists, graduate students, and hardware-software engineers dealing with the ever-increasing demands on fault-tolerance, scalability, and low power consumption. It is also an excellent resource for teaching advanced undergraduate and graduate students about the fundamentals concepts, organization, and actual hardware-software design of reliable neuromorphic systems with learning and fault-tolerance capabilities.",Book,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

Due to the critical role of rice in the global food security, great efforts have been made in order to develop new rice varieties with good agronomic traits, such as biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. The CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a promising system for the improvement of various traits of crop plants because of its efficiency, simplicity, and versatility. In this mini review, we discussed the applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to improve a wide range of traits in rice varieties adapted to unfavorable conditions. Specifically, a number of functional and regulatory genes that are associated with diseases (rice blast, bacterial blight) and pesticide resistance and abiotic stress (salinity, drought, and cold) tolerance have been functionally characterized via the mutants produced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Additionally, the advances and limitations of using CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice plants were discussed.

Masked Face Detection with Illumination Awareness,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4775/,"Dinh, Tran HiepNguyen, Linh TrungTran Hiep Dinh","Mask mandate has been applied in many countries in the last two years as a simple but effective way to limit the Covid-19 transmission. Besides the guidance from authorities regarding mask use in public, numerous vision-based approaches have been developed to aid with the monitoring of face mask wearing. Despite promising results have been obtained, several challenges in vision-based masked face detection still remain, primarily due to the insufficient of a quality dataset covering adequate variations in lighting conditions, object scales, mask types, or occlusion levels. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of a lightweight masked face detection system under different lighting conditions and the possibility of enhancing its performance with the employment of an image enhancement algorithm and an illumination awareness classifier. A dataset of human subjects with and without face masks in different lighting conditions is first introduced. An illumination awareness classifier is then trained on the collected dataset, the labeling of which is processed automatically based on the difference in detection accuracy when an image enhancement algorithm is taken into account. Experimental results have shown that the combination of the masked face detection system with the illumination awareness and an image enhancement algorithm can boost the system performance to up to 8.6%, 7.4%, and 8.5% in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and AP-M, respectively.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

Vortex particle method with iterative Brinkman penalization for simulation of flow past sharp-shape bodies,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4773/,"Duong Viet, DungLavi Rizki, ZuhalDuong Viet Dung","This paper presents a Lagrangian vortex method combined with iterative Brinkman penalization for the simulation of incompressible flow past a complex geometry. In the proposed algorithm, particle and penalization domains are separately introduced. The particle domain is for the computation of particle convection and diffusion, while the penalization domain is the enforcement of the wall boundary conditions. In iterative Brinkman penalization, the no-slip boundary condition is enforced by applying penalization force in multiple times within each time step. This enables large time step size reducing computational cost and maintains the capability in handling complex geometries. The method is validated for benchmark problems such as an impulsively started flow past a circular cylinder, normal to a flat plate, and a symmetric airfoil at Reynolds numbers ranging from 550 to 1000. The vorticity and streamline contours, drag, and lift coefficients show a good agreement with those reported in literature.",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

In terms of the management of the environment and water resources, precise identification is required of areas susceptible to flooding to support planners in implementing effective prevention strategies. The objective of this study is to develop a novel hybrid approach based on Bald Eagle Search (BES), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bagging (BA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to generate a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue province, Vietnam. In total, 1621 flood points and 14 predictor variables were used in this study. These data were divided into 60 for model training, 20 for model validation and 20 for testing. In addition, various statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that BES, for the first time, successfully improved the performance of individual models in building a flood susceptibility map in Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam, namely SVM, RF, BA and MLP, with high accuracy (AUC &gt; 0.9). Among the models proposed, BA-BES was most effective with AUC = 0.998, followed by RF-BES (AUC = 0.998), MLP-BES (AUC = 0.998), and SVM-BES (AUC = 0.99).

The optimization of water allocation for agriculture requires accurate soil moisture (SM) monitoring.

It presents the advantage of sensing a whole surface around a reference GNSS antenna.

Study of Thermodynamic Effect on the Mechanism of Flashing Flow under Pressurized Hot Water by a Homogeneous Model,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4559/,"Le, Anh DinhDr Anh Le Dinh","The flashing flow in a Moby_Dick converging-diverging nozzle under pressurized hot water from 460.5 K to 483.5 K is simulated using a homogeneous compressible water-vapor two-phase flow model. The kinematic and thermodynamic mass transfer are accessed using the cavitation model based on the Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir equation. Our simplified thermodynamic model is coupled with the governing equations to capture the phase-change heat transfer. This numerical method proved its reliability through a comparison with available experimental data of flow parameters inside the nozzle. Consequently, the present numerical method shows good potential for simulating the flashing flow under pressurized hot water conditions. The satisfying prediction of averaged flow parameters with a slight improvement compared to reference numerical data is reproduced. The results confirm a noticeable impact of the thermodynamic effect on the mechanism of flashing flow, resulting in a considerable decrease in the flow temperature and the saturated vapor pressure. The flashing non-equilibrium is significantly decreased, forcing the flashing flow to be classified as the usual cavitation behavior and better suited to homogeneous model. While the temperature drop is highly dependent on evaporation, the thermodynamic suppression is influenced by the condensation. The suppression effect, unobserved in water at a lower temperature in previous studies, is noticeable for the pressurized hot water flow characterized by the cavitation mechanism. The vapor void fraction decreased considerably in the radial and axial directions as the water temperature rose to 483.5 K in this study.",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

The Hsp70 families have been reported in many plant species, unfortunately, no information on this important protein family in papaya (Carica papaya). The objective of this study was to provide comprehensive information on the CpHsp70 family in papaya. Materials and Methods: The CpHsp70 genes in the papaya genome were identified by a basic local alignment search tool against the papaya genome database by using well-known Arabidopsis Hsp70-s. Sequences were then analyzed by various bioinformatics tools to investigate the characteristics of the CpHsp70 family. Results: A total of 12 members of the CpHsp70 family has been identified and characterized in papaya. By using various computational tools, these results revealed that all general characteristics of the CpHsp70 family, like physic-chemical parameters, gene structure, phylogenetic tree and subcellular localization were provided.

Automatic scan range for dose-reduced multiphase CT imaging of the liver utilizing CNNs and Gaussian models,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4765/,"Luu, Manh HaWalsum, Theo vanMai, Hong SonFranklin, DanielNguyen, Thi Thu ThaoLe, Thi MyMoelker, AdraanLe, Van KhangVu, Dang LuuLe, Ngoc HaTran, Quoc LongChu, Duc TrinhNguyen, Linh TrungLưu Mạnh Hà","Multiphase CT scanning of the liver is performed for several clinical applications; however, radiation exposure from CT scanning poses a nontrivial cancer risk to the patients. The radiation dose may be reduced by determining the scan range of the subsequent scans by the location of the target of interest in the first scan phase. The purpose of this study is to present and assess an automatic method for determining the scan range for multiphase CT scans. Our strategy is to first apply a CNN-based method for detecting the liver in 2D slices, and to use a liver range search algorithm for detecting the liver range in the scout volume. The target liver scan range for subsequent scans can be obtained by adding safety margins achieved from Gaussian liver motion models to the scan range determined from the scout. Experiments were performed on 657 multiphase CT volumes obtained from multiple hospitals. The experiment shows that the proposed liver detection method can detect the liver in 223 out of a total of 224 3D volumes on average within one second, with mean intersection of union, wall distance and centroid distance of 85.5%, 5.7 mm and 9.7 mm, respectively. In addition, the performance of the proposed liver detection method is comparable to the best of the state-of-the-art 3D liver detectors in the liver detection accuracy while it requires less processing time. Furthermore, we apply the liver scan range generation method on the liver CT images acquired from radiofrequency ablation and Y-90 transarterial radioembolization (selective internal radiation therapy) interventions of 46 patients from two hospitals. The result shows that the automatic scan range generation can significantly reduce the effective radiation dose by an average of 14.5% (2.56 mSv) compared to manual performance by the radiographer from Y-90 transarterial radioembolization, while no statistically significant difference in performance was found with the CT images from intra RFA intervention ( = 0.81). Finally, three radiologists assess both the original and the range-reduced images for evaluating the effect of the range reduction method on their clinical decisions. We conclude that the automatic liver scan range generation method is able to reduce excess radiation compared to the manual performance with a high accuracy and without penalizing the clinical decision.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

Để thực hiện các nghiên cứu khí hậu, dự đoán hạn hán và đánh giá tác động của chúng, cần theo dõi độ ẩm của đất. Các nghiên cứu gần đây cho thấy việc tận dụng các tín hiệu điều hướng được phát ra liên tục bởi các chòm sao của Hệ thống Vệ tinh Điều hướng Toàn cầu (GNSS) để thu thập các biến thể về độ ẩm của đất.

Support Vector Machine-based Phase Prediction of Multi-principal Element Alloys,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4742/,"Nguyen, Hai ChauKubo, MasatoshiLe, Viet HaiYamamoto, TomoyukiHải Châu Nguyễn","Designing new materials with desired properties is a complex and time-consuming process. One of the most challenging factors of the design process is the huge search space of possible materials. Machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) can contribute to this process by predicting materials properties accurately. Properties of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) highly depend on alloys’ phase. Thus, accurate prediction of the alloy’s phase is important to narrow down the search space. In this paper, we propose a solution of employing support vector machine method with hyperparameters tuning and the use of weighted values for prediction of the alloy’s phase. Using the dataset consisting of the experimental results of 118 MPEAs, our solution achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 90.2%. We confirm the superiority of this score over the performance of ANN statistically. On the other dataset containing 401 MPEAs, our SVM model is comparable to ANN and exhibits 70.6% cross-validation accuracy. We also found that additional variables, including average melting temperature and standard deviation of melting temperature, increase prediction accuracy by 3.34% in the best case.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

It can have heavy human and material impacts and, in recent years, flooding has tended to occur more frequently, due to changes our species has made to hydrological regimes, and due to climate change. It is of the utmost importance that new models are developed to predict and map flood susceptibility with high accuracy, to support decision-makers and planners in designing more effective flood management strategies. The objective of this study is the development of a new method based on state-of-the-art machine learning and remote sensing, namely random forest (RF), dingo optimization algorithm, a weighted chimp optimization algorithm (WChOA), and particle swarm optimization to build flood susceptibility maps in the Nghe An province of Vietnam. The CyGNSS system was used to collect soil moisture data to integrate into the susceptibility model. A total of 1650 flood locations and 14 conditioning factors were used to construct the model. These data were divided at a ratio of 60/20/20 to train, validate, and test the model, respectively. In addition, various statistical indices, namely root-mean-square error, receiver operation characteristic, mean absolute error, and the coefficient of determination (R2), were used to assess the performance of the model. The results for all the models were good, with an AUC value of + 0.9. The RF-WChOA model performed best, with an AUC value of 0.99.

The results show that, when increasing the temperature from T = 300 K to T = 7000 K, P = 0.0 GPa, the size (1) of the Fe2O3 materials increases, the energy (E) increases, the length link (r) decreased, the number of structural units FeO4, FeO5 increased, and FeO6 decreased. Similarly, as the pressure (P) is increased, from P = 0 GPa to P = 360 GPa at temperatures T, l decreases, E increases, r decreases, FeO4 decreases and disappears, FeO5 decreases, and FeO6 increases at high P with P ≥ 150 GPa, FeO5 disappeared at P ≥ 250 GPa and only FeO6 appeared at T = 2300, 7000 K.

Riemannian Matched Field Processing,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4784/,"Tran Cao, QuyenTráº§n Cao Quyá»�n","As far as underwater source localization is concerned the Matched Field Processing (MFP) is an effective method. Floating ship localization, submarine localization in military section and fish finding in civilization are considered as the main application of MFP. Besides, determining environmental parameters such as sound speed profile, bottom topography and array tilt are also developed. Some methods such as empirical mode decomposition, adaptive MFP, compressive MFP and especially stochastic MFP using Riemannian geometry (RMFP) have been introduced recently in order to increase MFP’s reliability and resolution. It seems that the RMFP is the strongest candidate for the future development of MFP since it is inherited the strong foundation of both MFP and Riemannian Geometry. Surprisingly, not only the nature of curvature of sound wave but also the nature of MFP are exploited in RMFP. The aim of this monograph is introduce RMFP by considering the Riemannian distance instead of Euclidean distance. Two approaches of RMFP construction, i.e., iso-metric mappings and direct Riemannian distance calculation are introduced. The organization of this monograph is as follows. Two first chapters of this monograph revised the reader about the essential meaning of Gauss Curvature, Geodesic equation, iso-metric mapping in Riemannian Geometry and the state of the art of MFP. Chapter 3 presents Riemannian MFP. Chapter 4 concludes the monograph with discussions about the performance of MFP.

However the algorithm is seldom used for finding the azimuthal direction of the source and is still not considered for multiple field replicas due to the variation of sound velocity. If using cylindrical hydrophone array (CHA) with 32x10 elements (ten ring with each ring of 32 elements) the rough azimuthal angle resolution, theta=9 degree , is obtained. Then using TDOA (Time difference of arrival) of the two selected consecutive beams of CHA the system could provide the bearing accuracy up to theta opt=theta/80=0.1 degree . Then, the range and the depth of the source are the solution of the proposed Riemannian MFP with the assumption of cylindrical spreading. The proposed RMFP is on the basis of Riemannian distance which is calculated directly by solving the geodesic equation on cylinder surface. The simulations show that only with the data from selected vertical hydrophone array of CHA (there are 32 vertical arrays on cylindrical array) is enough to locate the range and the depth of underwater source precisely.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Towards Robust Cognitive 3D Brain-inspired Cross-paradigm System,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4459/,"Abdallah, Abderazek BenDang, Nam KhanhKhanh N. Dang","Spiking Neuromorphic systems have been introduced as promising platforms for energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNNs) execution. SNNs incorporate neuronal and synaptic states in addition to the variant time scale into their computational model. Since each neuron in these networks is connected to many others, high bandwidth is required. Moreover, since the spike times are used to encode information in SNN, a precise communication latency is also needed, although SNN is tolerant to the spike delay variation in some limits when it is seen as a whole. The two-dimensional packet-switched network-on-chip was proposed as a solution to provide a scalable interconnect fabric in large-scale spike-based neural networks. The 3D-ICs have also attracted a lot of attention as a potential solution to resolve the interconnect bottleneck. Combining these two emerging technologies provides a new horizon for IC design to satisfy the high requirements of low power and small footprint in emerging AI applications. Moreover, although fault-tolerance is a natural feature of biological systems, integrating many computation and memory units into neuromorphic chips confronts the reliability issue, where a defective part can affect the overall system's performance. This paper presents R-NASH - a reliable three-dimensional digital neuromorphic system geared explicitly toward the 3D-ICs biological brain's three-dimensional structure, where information in the network is represented by sparse patterns of spike timing and learning is based on the local spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule. Our platform enables high integration density and small spike delay of spiking networks and features a scalable design. R-NASH is a design based on the Through-Silicon-Via technology, facilitating spiking neural network implementation on clustered neurons based on Network-on-Chip. We provide a memory interface with the host CPU, allowing for online training and inference of spiking neural networks. Moreover, R-NASH supports fault recovery with graceful performance degradation.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

HotCluster: A thermal-aware defect recovery method for Through-Silicon-Vias Towards Reliable 3-D ICs systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4430/,"Dang, Nam KhanhAhmed, Akram BenAbdallah, Abderazek BenTran, Xuan TuKhanh N. Dang","Through Silicon Via (TSV) is considered as the near-future solution to realize low-power and high-performance 3D-Integrated Circuits (3D-ICs) and 3D-Network-on-Chips (3DNoCs). However, the lifetime reliability issue of TSV due to its fault sensitivity and the high operating temperature of 3D-ICs, which also accelerates the fault-rate, is one of the most critical challenges. Meanwhile, most current works focus on detecting and correcting TSV defects after manufacturing without considering high-temperature nodes’ impact on lifetime reliability. Besides, the recovery for defective clusters is also challenging because of costly redundancies. In this work, we present HotCluster: a hotspot-aware self-correction platform for clustering defects in 3D-NoCs to help understand and tackle this problem. We first give a method to predict normalized fault rates and place redundant TSV groups according to each region’s fault rate. In our particular medium fault-rate (normalized to the coolest area), HotCluster reduces about 60% of the redundancies in comparison to the uniformly distributed redundancies while having a higher ratio of router working in a normal state. Furthermore, HotCluster integrates both online (weight-based) and offline (max-flow min-cut offline method) mapping algorithms to help the system correct the faulty TSV clusters. The experimental results show that both the max-flow min-cut offline method and weight-based online mode with a redundancy of 0.25 exhibits less than 1% of routers disabled under 50% defect-rates.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

MigSpike: A Migration Based Algorithms and Architecture for Scalable Robust Neuromorphic Systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4654/,"Dang, Nam KhanhDoan, Nguyen Anh VuAbdallah, Abderazek BenKhanh N. Dang","While conventional hardware neuromorphic systems usually consist of multiple clusters of neurons that communicate via an interconnect infrastructure, scaling up them confronts the reliability issue when faults in the neuron circuits and synaptic weight memories can cause faulty outputs. This work presents a method named MigSpike that allows placing spare neurons for repairing with the support of enhanced migrating methods and the built-in hardware architecture for migrating neurons between nodes (clusters of neurons). MigSpike architecture supports migrating the unmapped neurons from their nodes to suitable ones within the system by creating chains of migrations. Furthermore, a max-ﬂow min-cut adaptation and a genetic algorithm approach are presented to solve the aforementioned problem. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods support recovery up to 100% of spare neurons. While the max-ﬂow min-cut adaption can execute milliseconds, the genetic algorithm can help reduce the migration cost with a graceful degradation on communication cost. With a system of 256 neurons per node and a 20% fault rate, our approach minimizes the migration cost from remapping by 10.19× and 96.13× under Networks-on-Chip of 4×4 (smallest) and 16×16×16 (largest), respectively. The Mean-Time-to-Failure evaluation also shows an approximate 10× of lifetime expectancy by having a 20% spare rate.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

The shells are exposed to external harmonic excitation and are placed in the thermal situations. The modeling of shells is derived according to the classical shell theory and the non-linear geometric von Kármán relationships. It is considered that the distribution of material properties changes along the thickness direction based on a power law index. The smeared stiffener technique is considered to model the stiffened shells. An approximation, according to Galerkin’s approach, is utilized to reduction of the shell governing equations into the non-linear coupled ordinary differential relations. The ODE equations are analytically solved and analyzed through the perturbation methodology for investigating the resonance behavior of shells. Simulation results are reported to examine the influences of stiffeners, initial imperfection, foundation coefficients, thermal environment, and geometrical characteristics on the non-linear primary resonance response of doubly curved shallow shells.

Improving Graph Convolutional Networks with Transformer Layer in social-based items recommendation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4688/,"Hoang, Thi LinhPham, Tuan DungTa, Viet CuongThi Linh Hoang","With the emergence of online social networks, social-based items recommendation has become a popular research direction. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks have shown promising results by modeling the information diffusion process in graphs. It provides a unified framework for graph embedding that can leverage both the social graph structure and node features information. In this paper, we improve the embedding output of the graph-based convolution layer by adding a number of transformer layers. The transformer layers with attention architecture help discover frequent patterns in the embedding space which increase the predictive power of the model in the downstream tasks. Our approach is tested on two social-based items recommendation dataset, Ciao and Epinions and our model outperforms other graph-based recommendation baselines.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4688/2/Improving_Graph_Convolutional_Networks_with_Transformer_Layer_in_social-based_items_recommendation_IEEE_Express.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2021
An Innovative Method based on Shannon Energy Envelope and Summit Navigation for Detecting R Peaks of Noise Stress Test Signals,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4348/,"Hoang, Van ManhPham, Manh ThangVan Manh Hoang","In recent decades, there has been an increased demand for the processing of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals because of its significant role in diagnosing cardiac diseases. The QRS complex is the dominant feature of the ECG signal. The detection of QRS complexes is thus an essential part of almost any ECG signal processing systems. This paper presents a developed QRS complex detection method using dominant peak extraction and Shannon energy envelope for useful ECG signal analysis. The algorithm is divided into three main stages: preprocessing, searching for dominant peaks, and removing false R peaks. The proposed algorithm is validated in static ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB) and noise-contaminated ECG stress tests from the Glasgow University Database (GUDB), separately. The method compares favorably with conventional and recently published results of many QRS detection algorithms on the same MITDB. Subsequently, valuable performance coefficients are also found on the GUDB. The average detection accuracy of finding R peaks exceed 99% on both the databases, especially for cardiac stress test records with high interference levels. The method enables a highly effective ECG signal processing tool under various noises, artifacts, abnormalities, and morphologies.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

Compared to previous High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, VVC saves up to 50% bitrate for equal perceptual video quality. To reach this efficiency, Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) has introduced a number of improvement techniques to VVC model. As a result, the complexity of VVC encoding also greatly increases. One of the new techniques affects to the growing of complexity is the quad-tree nested multi-type tree (QTMT) including binary split and ternary splits, which lead to a block in VVC with various shapes in both square and rectangle. Based on the aforementioned information we propose in this paper a new deep learning based fast QTMT method. We use a learned convolutional neural network (CNN) model namely EarlyTerminated Hierarchical CNN to predict the coding unit map and then fed into the VVC encoder to early terminate the block partitioning process.

The results showed that the most suitable medium for the adventitious shoot regeneration from leaf explants in chrysanthemum was MS, 30 g/l sucrose, 7 g/l agar, pH 5.8, supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BAP. After 5 cultured weeks, the number of shoots per explants, the number of leaves per shoot, and the length of the shoot were 4.37 (shoots/explant), 4.25 (amount of leaves/shoot), and 1.96 (cm), respectively.

This paper studies WMU performance in millimeter wave cellular systems in three aspects such as throughput, Average Packet Delay (APD) and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR). The multi-slope model in which is recommended by 3GPP to simulate wireless communication is utilized to estimate the received signal power at the WMU in downlink. In order to improve the WMU performance, the Carrier Aggregation technique which has been introduced for Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is studied. By utilizing CA scheme, the WMU is allowed to utilize more than one sub-carrier to perform communications.

Fractional Frequency Reuse in Ultra Dense Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4589/,"Lam, Sinh CongTran, Xuan NamDr Sinh Cong Lam","Ultra Dense Network (UDN) in which Base Stations (BSs) are deployed at an ultra high density is a promising network model of the future wireless generation. Due to ultra densification, reuse of frequency bands with an ultra high density is compulsory for this network. Conventionally, the research on frequency reuse technique such as Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) classifies the active users into only two groups. However, this approach is not suitable for UDNs where the signal experiences a huge amount of power loss over distances. Thus, this paper proposes a generalized model of FFR for UDNs where the active users are classified into more than two groups The paper introduces a simple approach to obtain the coverage probability of a typical user in the case of a general path loss model. In the case of stretched path loss model for UDNs, the closed-form expression of user coverage probability is derived. From the analytical and simulation results, it is stated that the proposed model can improve user performance without increasing BS power consumption. Furthermore, two additional interesting conclusions are found in this paper: (i) the user coverage probability increases to a peak before passing a decline when the density of BSs increases; (ii) an increase in BS transmission power may decrease the user performance.",Article,"5G, Ultra Dense Network, Fractional Frequency Reuse, Poisson Point Process, Coverage probability",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874490721001701,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Assessment of a Homogeneous Model for Simulating a Cavitating Flow in Water under a Wide Range of Temperatures,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4444/,"Le, Anh DinhDr Anh Le Dinh","The cavitating flow on a NACA0015 hydrofoil in water under a wide range of temperatures is simulated with or without non-condensation gas using a homogeneous model. Our simplified thermodynamic model is coupled with governing equations to capture the latent heat transfer in cavitation. A numerical evaluation proves its applicability through a comparison with experimental data. As a result, the numerical evaluation illustrates good agreement with measured data for both simulations with or without non-condensation gas. The expected prediction pressure coefficient is in better agreement with experimental data for high-temperature water compared to the existing numerical data. Although the temperature depression inside the cavity is confirmed numerically, the thermodynamic effect shows a weak impact on the cavitation behavior near the boiling temperature (100oC). The cavitating flow can therefore be simulated reasonably by an iso-thermal approach at a reasonable cost. The suppression of the void fraction as the water temperature increases is deduced by the flow behavior rather than the thermodynamic effect. Finally, the impact of a non-condensation gas is closely linked to the thermodynamic properties of the water and the flow behavior. The attached cavity position shifts closer to the hydrofoil leading edge significantly in high-temperature water, while an identical position is reproduced for room temperature conditions in comparison with the simulation without a non-condensation gas.",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

Volume hints to the size and/or scale of datasets. Until now, there is no universal threshold for data volume to be considered as big data, because of the time and diversity of datasets. Velocity indicates the speed of processing data. It can fall into three categories: streaming processing, real-time processing, or batch processing. Value alludes to the usefulness of data for decision making. Veracity denotes the quality and trustworthiness of datasets. Parallelization allows one to improve computation time by dividing big problems into smaller instances, distributing smaller tasks across multiple threads and then performing them simultaneously. Feature selection is useful for preparing high scale datasets.

These complementary mechanisms can act synergistically to improve sa‐ linity tolerance in the plant, which is then interesting in breeding programs to pyramidize comple‐ mentary QTLs (quantitative trait loci), to improve salinity stress tolerance of the plant at different developmental stages and in different environments. This approach presupposes the identification of salinity tolerance QTLs associated with different mechanisms involved in salinity tolerance, which requires the greatest possible genetic diversity to be explored. To contribute to this goal, we screened an original panel of 179 Vietnamese rice landraces genotyped with 21,623 SNP markers for salinity stress tolerance under 100 mM NaCl treatment, at the seedling stage, with the aim of identifying new QTLs involved in the salinity stress tolerance via a genome‐wide association study (GWAS). Nine salinity tolerance‐related traits, including the salt injury score, chlorophyll and water content, and K+ and Na+ contents were measured in leaves. GWAS analysis allowed the identifica‐ tion of 26 QTLs. Interestingly, ten of them were associated with several different traits, which indi‐ cates that these QTLs act pleiotropically to control the different levels of plant responses to salinity stress. Twenty‐one identified QTLs colocalized with known QTLs. Several genes within these QTLs have functions related to salinity stress tolerance and are mainly involved in gene regulation, signal transduction or hormone signaling. Our study provides promising QTLs for breeding programs to enhance salinity tolerance and identifies candidate genes that should be further functionally studied to better understand salinity tolerance mechanisms in rice.",Article,"Agriculture Technology

In this paper, we introduce a new interpretation of the MCRB, called the generalized MCRB (GMCRB), via the Moore–Penrose inverse operator. This bound is useful for singular problems and particularly blind channel estimation problems in which the Hessian matrix is noninvertible. Two closed-form expressions of the GMCRB are derived for unbiased blind estimators when the channel order is misspecified. The first bound deals with deterministic models where both the channel and unknown symbols are deterministic. The second one is devoted to stochastic models where we assume that transmitted symbols are unknown random variables i.i.d. drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Two case studies of channel order misspecification are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GMCRBs over the classical CRBs. When the channel order is known or accurately estimated, both generalized bounds reduce to the classical bounds. Besides, the stochastic GMCRB is lower than the deterministic one, especially at high SNR.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Robust Subspace Tracking with Missing Data and Outliers: Novel Algorithm with Convergence Guarantee,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4435/,"Le, Trung ThanhNguyen, Viet DungNguyen, Linh TrungAbed-Meraim, KarimLê Trung Thành","In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely PETRELS-ADMM, to deal with subspace tracking in the presence of outliers and missing data. The proposed approach consists of two main stages: outlier rejection and subspace estimation. In the first stage, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is effectively exploited to detect outliers affecting the observed data. In the second stage, we propose an improved version of the parallel estimation and tracking by recursive least squares (PETRELS) algorithm to update the underlying subspace in the missing data context. We then present a theoretical convergence analysis of PETRELS-ADMM which shows that it generates a sequence of subspace solutions converging to the optimum of its batch counterpart. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, is illustrated on both simulated and real data.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381678,Advanced Insitute of Engineering and Technology (AVITECH),2021
A Proactive Method of the Webshell Detection and Prevention based on Deep Traffic Analysis,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4645/,"Le, Viet HaDu, Phuong HanhNguyen, Ngoc CuongNguyen, Ngoc HoaHoang, Viet LongAssoc.Prof Hoá NGUYỄN Ngọc","The popularity of today's web application has led to web servers are frequently objects to injecting webshell attacks. In this paper, we propose a new deep inspection method, namely DLWD, to detect in real-time and proactively prevent webshell attacks. DLWSD is composed of both signature-based and DNN deep learning-based detection. Moreover, to avoid bottlenecks, DLWSD built-in DeepInspector inspects in real-time the large-scale traffic flows with a strategy of periodic sampling at a defined frequency and interval for only flows that do not satisfy any signature. DeepInspector can create/update rules from webshell attacking alert results to prevent in future. We also proposed a mechanism using the cross-entropy loss function to regulate the training imbalanced dataset. Our experiments allow validating the performance of DLWSD using a popular dataset CSE-CIC-IDS2018 with the metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, FPR) of (99.99%, 99.98%, 0.01%) respectively.

An Efficient Hybrid Webshell Detection Method for Webserver of Marine Transportation Systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4644/,"Le, Viet HaNguyen, Ngoc TuNguyen, Ngoc HoaLe, LinhAssoc.Prof Hoá NGUYỄN Ngọc","An increase in the number of Maritime Intelligent Transport Systems (MITSs) also means an increase in the number of information security risks. Usually, the administration and operation of MITSs are done through web servers that are frequently targeted by hackers. In marine transportation industry, malicious code injection attacks (webshell) has been widely exploited by hackers to take full control of Web servers. Traditional webshell detection methods based on pattern matching that are no longer effective against new types of webshell. This motivates us to investigate the problem of detecting obfuscation or unknown webshells, termed OUW problem. In this work, we propose a pattern-matching-deep-learning hybrid ASP.NET webshell detection method (H-DLPMWD) to address the OUW problem. H-DLPMWD is based on Yara-based pattern matching to clean dataset; modeling ASP.NET code files as an operation code index (OCI) vectors; and applying CNN method to train and predict webshell in OCI vectors. To validate H-DLPMWD, our rigorous experimentation demonstrates that H-DLPMWD achieves an excellent accuracy of 98.49%, F1-score of 99.01%, and a low false positive rate of 1.75%.",Article,"Scopus-indexed journals

Existing TT decomposition algorithms are either of high computational complexity or operating in batch-mode, hence quite inefﬁcient for (near) real-time processing. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive algorithm for TT decomposition of streaming tensors whose slices are serially acquired over time. By leveraging the alternating minimization framework, our estimator minimizes an exponentially weighted least-squares cost function in an efﬁcient way.

Efficiently compressing 3D medical images for teleinterventions via CNNs and anisotropic diffusion,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4671/,"Luu, Manh HaXiem, HoangVanDr. Xiem HoangVan","Purpose: Efficient compression of images while preserving image quality has the potential to be a major enabler of effective remote clinical diagnosis and treatment, since poor Internet connection conditions are often the primary constraint in such services. This paper presents a framework for organ-specific image compression for teleinterventions based on a deep learning approach and anisotropic diffusion filter. Methods: The proposed method, deep learning and anisotropic diffusion (DLAD), uses a convolutional neural network architecture to extract a probability map for the organ of interest; this probability map guides an anisotropic diffusion filter that smooths the image except at the location of the organ of interest. Subsequently, a compression method, such as BZ2 and HEVC-visually lossless, is applied to compress the image. We demonstrate the proposed method on three-dimensional (3D) CT images acquired for radio frequency ablation (RFA) of liver lesions. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method on 151 CT images using peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR ), structural similarity ( SSIM ), and compression ratio ( CRCR ) metrics. Finally, we compare the assessments of two radiologists on the liver lesion detection and the liver lesion center annotation using 33 sets of the original images and the compressed images. Results: The results show that the method can significantly improve CRCR of most well-known compression methods. DLAD combined with HEVC-visually lossless achieves the highest average CRCR of 6.45, which is 36% higher than that of the original HEVC and outperforms other state-of-the-art lossless medical image compression methods. The means of PSNRPSNR and SSIMSSIM are 70 dB and 0.95, respectively. In addition, the compression effects do not statistically significantly affect the assessments of the radiologists on the liver lesion detection and the lesion center annotation. Conclusions: We thus conclude that the method has a high potential to be applied in teleintervention applications.",Article,Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4671/10.1002/mp.14814.%20Epub%202021%20Apr%205.%20PMID:%2033656213.,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2021

Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to estimate amino acid substitution models; however, they are typically complicated and slow. In this article, we propose QMaker, a new ML method to estimate a general time-reversible Q matrix from a large protein data set consisting of multiple sequence alignments. QMaker combines an efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for handling the model heterogeneity among alignments, and the consideration of rate mixture models among sites. We provide QMaker as a user-friendly function in the IQ-TREE software package (http://www.iqtree.org) supporting the use of multiple CPU cores so that biologists can easily estimate amino acid substitution models from their own protein alignments. We used QMaker to estimate new empirical general amino acid substitution models from the current Pfam database as well as five clade-specific models for mammals, birds, insects, yeasts, and plants. Our results show that the new models considerably improve the fit between model and data and in some cases influence the inference of phylogenetic tree topologies.[Amino acid replacement matrices; amino acid substitution models; maximum likelihood estimation; phylogenetic inferences.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Enhanced nodal gradient finite elements with new numerical integration schemes for 2D and 3D geometrically nonlinear analysis,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4354/,"Nguyen, Dinh DuNguyen, Minh NgocNguyen, Dinh DucJaroon, RungamornratBui, Quoc TinhProf. Dinh Duc Nguyen","The consecutive-interpolation procedure (CIP) has been recently proposed as an enhanced technique for traditional finite element method (FEM) with various desirable properties such as continuous nodal gradients and higher accuracy without increasing the total number of degrees of freedom (DOFs). It is common knowledge that linear finite elements, e.g., four-node quadrilateral (Q4) or eight-node hexahedral (HH8) elements, are not highly suitable for geometrically nonlinear analysis. The elements with quadratic interpolation functions have to be used instead. In this paper, the CIP-enhanced four-node quadrilateral element (CQ4), and the CIP-enhanced eight-node hexahedral element (CHH8), are for the first time extended to investigate geometrically nonlinear problems of two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures. To further enhance the efficiency of the present approaches, novel numerical integration schemes based on the concept of mid-point rules, namely element mid-points (EM) and element mid-edges (EE) are integrated into the present CQ4 element. For CHH8, the 3D-version of EM (namely 3D-EM) and the element mid-faces (EF) scheme are investigated. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the two novel quadrature schemes in both regular and irregular (distorted) meshes are analyzed. Numerical results indicate that the new integration approaches perform more efficiently than the well-known Gaussian quadrature while gaining equivalent accuracy. The performance of the CIP-enhanced elements, which is examined through numerical experiments, is found to be equivalent to that of quadratic Lagrangian finite element counterparts, while having the same discretization with that by the linear finite elements. In addition, we also apply the present CQ4 and CHH8 elements associated with different numerical integration techniques to nearly incompressible materials.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4354/1/S0307904X20306922,Department of Civil Engineering and Transportation (CET),2021

One of the challenging factors of the design process is the huge search space of possible materials. Machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) can contribute to this process by predicting materials properties accurately. Properties of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) highly depend on alloys’ phase. Thus, accurate prediction of the alloy’s phase is important to narrow down the search space. In this paper, we propose a solution of employing support vector machine method with hyperparameters tuning and the use of weights values for prediction of the alloy’s phase.

In this paper, we introduce a new optimization problem called the min-cost Parallel Drone Scheduling Vehicle Routing Problem (PDSVRP). This problem is a variant of the well-known Parallel Drone Scheduling Traveling Salesman Problem (PDSTSP) recently introduced in the literature in which we allow multiple trucks and consider the objective of minimizing the total transportation costs. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program and then develop a Ruin and Recreate (R&R) algorithm. Exploiting PDSVRP solution characteristics in an effective manner, our heuristic manages to introduce \sufficient"" rooms to a solution via new removal operators during the ruin phase. It is expected to enhance the possibilities for improving solutions later in the recreate phase. Multiple experiments on a new set of randomly generated instances confirm the performance of our approach. To explore the benefits of drone delivery as well as the insight into the impact of related factors on the contribution of drones’ use to operational cost, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. We also adapt the proposed algorithm to solve the PDSTSP and validate it via benchmarks available in the literature.

The microstructure investigation showed the small and large grain size regions corresponding to the R3c and Pbam/Pbnm phases, respectively. The dependence of magnetization on the Ti concentration suggested that the weak ferromagnetism observed in the compounds arised from the intrinsic collapse of cycloidal order rather than defect-induced magnetism.

A Hypercuboid-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Malware Classification,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4445/,"Nguyen, Thi Thu TrangNguyen, Dai ThoVu, Duy LoiDr. Dai Tho Nguyen","Malware attacks have been among the most serious threats to cyber security in the last decade. Anti-malware software can help safeguard information systems and minimize their exposure to the malware. Most of anti-malware programs detect malware instances based on signature or pattern matching. Data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to automatically detect models and patterns behind different types of malware variants. However, traditional machine-based learning techniques such as SVM, decision trees and naive Bayes seem to be only suitable for detecting malicious code, not effective enough for complex problems such as classification. In this article, we propose a new prototype extraction method for non-traditional prototype-based machine learning classification. The prototypes are extracted using hypercuboids. Each hypercuboid covers all training data points of a malware family. Then we choose the data points nearest to the hyperplanes as the prototypes. Malware samples will be classified based on the distances to the prototypes. Experiments results show that our proposition leads to F1 score of 96.5% for classification of known malware and 97.7% for classification of unknown malware, both better than the original prototype-based classification method.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Malware classification, machine learning, k-nearest neighbors algorithms, prototype-based learning, hypercuboids",https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4445/1/A-Hypercuboid-Based-Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Malware-Classification.pdf,"Information Technology (IT)

Iterative Learning Sliding Mode Control for UAV Trajectory Tracking,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4622/,"Nguyen, Van LanhPhung, Manh DuongQuang, HaDr Manh Duong Phung","This paper presents a novel iterative learning sliding mode controller (ILSMC) that can be applied to the trajectory tracking of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to model uncertainties and external disturbances. Here, the proposed ILSMC is integrated in the outer loop of a controlled system. The control development, conducted in the discrete-time domain, does not require a priori information of the disturbance bound as with conventional SMC techniques. It only involves an equivalent control term for the desired dynamics in the closed loop and an iterative learning term to drive the system state toward the sliding surface to maintain robust performance. By learning from previous iterations, the ILSMC can yield very accurate tracking performance when a sliding mode is induced without control chattering. The design is then applied to the attitude control of a 3DR Solo UAV with a built-in PID controller. The simulation results and experimental validation with real-time data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control scheme over existing techniques.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Co Dang Nguyen","We have systematically studied the crystal and electronic structures and the magnetic and electrical polarization properties of polycrystalline Ba0.95Y0.05Fe12−xMnxO19 (denoted as BaYFe12−xMnxO19) compounds with x = 0–2. The analyzes of X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman scattering spectra indicated their single phase in the M-type hexaferrite structure. With increasing x, the lattice constant a slightly increased while c decreased, which related to the Jahn-Teller effect. Though an increase of x reduced gradually magnetization in a range of 23–32 emu/g, the coercive force increased from 3.3 kOe for x = 0 to about 4 kOe for x = 0.5–2. The study of the electrical polarization properties proved the dependence of the shape of electric hysteresis loops on x and applied electric field. The samples with x = 0 and 0.5 exhibit a weak ferroelectricity with the maximum polarization of ~0.11 μC/cm2 for x = 0, and of ~0.06 μC/cm2 for x = 0.5. Meanwhile, the other samples showed nearly circular hysteresis loops, which are characteristic of conductive materials. Detailed investigations indicated an increase in leakage current when x increased. All of such phenomena are tightly related to the chemical shift of Mn2+ → Mn3+ and the replacement of Mn2+,3+ for Fe3+ in BaYFe12−xMnxO19. These oxidation states and the chemical shift of Mn have been confirmed upon analyzing X-ray absorption spectra",Article,"Engineering Physics

Specifically, a free area is added between cohesion and separation areas and the new rules are set according to sensing partition. Thanks to the free area, alignment control is purely managed without the influence of the heading disturbance caused by cohesion and separation. With the new Boids rules, the aggregation rate can be controlled by a single cohesion factor alpha.

The embedded devices produce masses of data day after day requiring a strong network infrastructure. The inclusion of messaging protocols like MQTT is important to ensure as few errors as possible in sending millions of IoT messages. This protocol is a great component of the IoT universe due to its lightweight design and low power consumption. Distributed MQTT systems are typically needed in actual application environments because centralized MQTT methods cannot accommodate a massive volume of data. Although being scalable decentralized MQTT systems, they are not suited to traffic workload variability. IoT service providers may incur expense because the computing resources are overestimated. This points to the need for a new approach to adapt workload fluctuation. Through proposing a modular MQTT framework, this article provides such an elasticity approach. In order to guarantee elasticity of MQTT server cluster while maintaining intact IoT implementation, the MQTT framework used off-the-shelf components.

In that field, precision feeding is widely acknowledged because of its potential to reduce feed costs, environmental footprint and to improve animal health and welfare. Precision feeding involves modern multidisciplinary technologies such as information technology, mechanics, electronics, automation, etc. Such a system consists of automatic troughs linked to a computer system to exploit data collected from the individual animals (e.g. body weight, feed intake and feeding behaviour), and/or from ambient sensors. Data is processed and analysed based on mathematical models to make predictions, warnings for farmers or to formulate diets that fit requirements of each individual animal at each production period. However, implementing such a system often requires high investment, which may go beyond the capabilities of smallholders and small/medium laboratories. Furthermore, the risk of implementing by design but not conforming to reality is very high. To avoid this problem, we introduce an agent-based modelling approach to simulate precision feeding systems for swine.

Disease transmission simulation programs are often deployed with different species, disease types, or epidemiological models, and each research team manages its own set of parameters relevant to their target diseases and concerns, resulting in limited cooperation and reuse of research results. Furthermore, these simulation and decision support tools often require a large amount of computational power, especially for models involving tens of thousands of herds with millions of individuals spread over a large geographical area such as a region or a country.

In this paper, we propose the MPBoot-MPI, a distributed algorithm efficiently implementing the idea of bootstrap approximation in MPBoot for a parallel computing environment of multiple computational nodes. MPBoot-MPI employs the master-worker paradigm and divides the work in MPBoot into three phases, each with a separate strategy to distribute computing among processes. Since the bootstrap trees are not calculated independently, processes must share results throughout task execution. We propose that when arriving at a checkpoint to report their results to the master process, worker processes apply a stochastic strategy to determine whether to perform the sending, thereby reducing the effect of latency caused by the large size of the message sent. Experiments on simulation and real benchmark datasets showed that MPBoot-MPI on multiple processes obtained MP scores and bootstrap accuracy comparable to MPBoot while achieving a promising speedup ratio.

Safety-enhanced UAV Path Planning with Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimization,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4436/,"Phung, Manh DuongQuang, HaDr Manh Duong Phung","This paper presents a new algorithm named spherical vector-based particle swarm optimization (SPSO) to deal with the problem of path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complicated environments subjected to multiple threats. A cost function is first formulated to convert the path planning into an optimization problem that incorporates requirements and constraints for the feasible and safe operation of the UAV. SPSO is then used to find the optimal path that minimizes the cost function by efficiently searching the configuration space of the UAV via the correspondence between the particle position and the speed, turn angle and climb/dive angle of the UAV. To evaluate the performance of SPSO, eight benchmarking scenarios have been generated from real digital elevation model maps. The results show that the proposed SPSO outperforms not only other particle swarm optimization (PSO) variants including the classic PSO, phase angle-encoded PSO and quantum-behave PSO but also other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms including the genetic algorithm (GA), artificial bee colony (ABC), and differential evolution (DE) in most scenarios.

Hence, sensitive data stored in the smart grid is vulnerable to malicious modification and theft. This paper proposes a framework to build a smart grid based on a highly effective private Ethereum network. Our framework provides a real smart grid that includes modern hardware and a smart contract to secure data in the blockchain network. To obtain high throughput but a low uncle rate, the difficulty calculation method used in the mining process of the Ethereum consensus mechanism is modified to adapt to the practical smart grid setup. The performance in terms of throughput and latency are evaluated by simulation and verified by the real smart grid setup. The enhanced private Ethereum-based smart grid has significantly better performance than the public one.

To mitigate frequency collisions as well as reduce the effects of co-channel interference between user's connections, we propose an interference-aware coordinated access control (IaCAC) mechanism for heterogeneous cellular D2D communication networks with dense device deployment of user equipment (UEs). In the proposed network setting, we consider the co-existence of both macro base stations (MBSs) and smallcell base stations (SBSs). In the proposed IaCAC mechanism, MBSs and SBSs are coordinated to perform access control to their UEs while MBSs allocate bandwidth parts dynamically to SBSs based on the interference levels measured at SBSs. Besides, to reduce D2D-to-cellular interference, device user equipments (DUEs) can perform power control autonomously. Simulation results show that the proposed IaCAC can provide higher system throughput and user throughput than those achieved by the network-assisted device-decided scheme proposed in [21]. Moreover, simulation results also reveal that the proposed IaCAC also significantly improve SINR of MUE’s and SUE’s uplink connections.",Article,Agriculture Technology,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4513/1/ijatcse1031022021.pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2021

Turbulent energy cascade associated with viscous reconnection of two vortex rings,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4598/,"Van Luc, NguyenToai Tuyn, PhanViet Dung, DuongNam Tuan Phuong, LeDuong Viet Dung","Collision of two vortex rings (VR) initially arranged in axis-offset and orthogonal configurations at Reynolds numbers (ReΓ ) in a range 5000−200 000 was simulated to investigate turbulent energy cascade associated with their reconnection. Two elliptical VRs are generated by joining each part of the first VR with another part of the second VR for the axis-offset collision. While two VRs associate to form a double U-shaped vortex, and this vortex reconnects itself at two points to form three elliptical VRs linked by the vortex filaments for the orthogonal collision. Many vortex structures in various scales and shapes, including small-scale VRs and horseshoe vortices, are observed in connection regions for both cases. As ReΓ increasing, the energy of formed small vortices raises and their wavenumber (k) range enlarges. The flow energy spectrum approaches a k−5/3 slope of the Kolmogorov hypotheses at low wavenumbers. For the axis-offset collision, the energy spectrum at medium wavenumbers continuously changes from k−3.0 at ReΓ = 5000 to k−1.8 at ReΓ =200 000, and the exponent (α) of the wavenumber is determined by a function as α = 0.3304ln(ReΓ ) − 5.6538. Meanwhile, the energy spectrum at two medium-wavenumber subranges for the orthogonal collision with ReΓ ≥ 20 000 approaches slopes of k−3.0 and k−2.6. Turbulent mixing performance due to the axis-offset collision of two vortex rings is better than that with the orthogonal one.",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

Vortex ring-tube reconnection in a viscous fluid,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4395/,"Van Luc, NguyenViet Dung, DuongDuong Viet Dung","The vortex ring-tube reconnection in a viscous fluid was investigated using a proposed vortex-in-cell method combined with a large eddy simulation model (LVIC). This method was verified using simulations of the Taylor–Green vortex flow at the Reynolds numbers (Re) 200 and 2000. The results show that the present method can capture the small-scale vortex structures in turbulent flows well. Besides, a Lagrangian method for passive scalar transport was successfully developed to track the vortex dynamics. The LVIC was then applied to three simulations of the interaction of a vortex ring at RerΓ(Γ/ν)=10000 and a vortex tube at RetΓ=1000, 5000, and 10 000. At RerΓ=10000 and RetΓ=1000, the effects of the tube on the ring are trivial while the ring breaks it into two parts and entrains them. The flow’s energy spectrum remains unchanged with time, the small-scale vortices are not generated, and the ring’s motion plays a key role in the flow. Moreover, the helicity distribution on the vortices is negligible. At RerΓ=10000 and RetΓ=5000, the tube breaks into two parts, and the leaving part of the tube interacts forcefully with the ring to form the small-scale vortices at the high wavenumbers. The population of small-scale vortex structures increases with time, and the large-scale vortices are twisted after the impingement. At RerΓ=10000 and RetΓ=10000, the impingement of the ring on the tube leads to their breakdown and reconnection. A part of the ring interacts with the leaving part of the tube to form a secondary ring, while the rest replaces the leaving part to reconnect the tube. The population of small-scale vortex structures and helicity distribution increase in this flow stage because of the interaction of the secondary ring wake and connection vortices. However, after the reconnection, the population and helicity distribution on the vortex structures significantly decrease. The smallest-scale vortex structure and the most effective mixing occur with RerΓ=10000 and RetΓ=5000.",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

For the left-offset case, a large part of the ring, slipping over the tube, associates with a small part of the tube to establish a new vortex ring, whereas the rest of the tube is reconnected by another part of the ring. For the center case, half of the ring joins with a part of the tube to construct an elliptical vortex ring while the rest connects because of viscosity. The reconnected ring and tube become more stable and are like the initial ones in the ultimate stage. For the right-offset case, both the ring and tube's reconnection occurs, and the reconnected elliptical vortex ring is rapidly distorted. The proportion of reconnected ring increases, and then this ring section loses its integrity, decaying into a complex cluster of various-scales vortex structures in different shapes. At σ 0 = 0.12r 0 , the secondary vortex structures surrounding the tube and ring appear in three cases, while they are only observed for the center case at σ 0 = 0.24r 0. For three flow configurations and two vortex core sizes, after the reconnection, the energy cascade of the flow approaches a k −5/3 slope of Kolmogorov's similarity hypotheses and a k −3 slope in the ranges of wavenumbers (k) from 3 to 10 and from 10 to 40, respectively. The highest population of small-scale coherent vortex structures is observed for the right-offset, followed by the center and left-offset. In addition, a larger number of these structures were observed for a smaller core size. This validates that the mixing performance is the best at a small vortex core and in the right-offset configuration.",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network with Feature Preservation and Autotuned Thresholding for Crack Detection,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4437/,"Zhu, QiuchenDinh, Tran HiepPhung, Manh DuongQuang, HaDr Manh Duong Phung","Drone imagery is increasingly used in automated inspection for infrastructure surface defects, especially in hazardous or unreachable environments. In machine vision, the key to crack detection rests with robust and accurate algorithms for image processing. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning approach using hierarchical convolutional neural networks with feature preservation (HCNNFP) and an intercontrast iterative thresholding algorithm for image binarization. First, a set of branch networks is proposed, wherein the output of previous convolutional blocks is half-sizedly concatenated to the current ones to reduce the obscuration in the down-sampling stage taking into account the overall information loss. Next, to extract the feature map generated from the enhanced HCNN, a binary contrast-based autotuned thresholding (CBAT) approach is developed at the post-processing step, where patterns of interest are clustered within the probability map of the identified features. The proposed technique is then applied to identify surface cracks on the surface of roads, bridges or pavements. An extensive comparison with existing techniques is conducted on various datasets and subject to a number of evaluation criteria including the average F-measure (AFβ) introduced here for dynamic quantification of the performance. Experiments on crack images, including those captured by unmanned aerial vehicles inspecting a monorail bridge. The proposed technique outperforms the existing methods on various tested datasets especially for GAPs dataset with an increase of about 1.4% in terms of AFβ while the mean percentage error drops by 2.2%.

The emergence of such resource-constrained devices raises significant challenges to current cryptographic algorithms. PHOTON is an ultra-lightweight cryptographic hash function targeting low-resource devices. The currently implemented hardware architectures of PHOTON hash function utilize a large amount of resources and have low operating frequencies with a low rate of throughputs. Maximum operating frequency and throughput of PHOTON architecture can be improved but at the cost of larger area utilization. Therefore, to improve the area-performance trade-offs of PHOTON hash function, an iterative architecture is implemented in this work. The concern is with the most lightweight version of PHOTON hash function with the hash size of 80 bits. It is implemented and verified on several Xilinx and Altera Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices using their synthesis and simulation tools. Low-cost and high-processing FPGA devices were both considered. The design is optimized for performance, whereas the area utilization is also taken into consideration. The overall performance and logic utilization are benchmarked with the existing implementations.

There have been numerous techniques that were proposed in 5G cellular technology for sustainability and enhancing the lifespan of centralized power sources in mobile and future IoT devices. Throughout this research paper, a literature review of the main current advancements of EH technology and SWIPT techniques will be presented as well as its achievements. An implementation of one of the Energy Harvesting techniques which is the SWIPT, in a cooperative relay scenario is presented in this paper and it is applied with a proper simulation tool. The simulation will mainly be implemented in MATLAB, which is divided into several functions computing the essential primary values for the proposed EH network. Firstly, the relay scenario that comprises a base station and two receivers with one receiver acting as a relay station while the other act as the final receiver for both transmissions. Secondly, the SWIPT technique is implemented in the Relay stations, where the AF protocol is utilized. Finally, the last receiver will receive both signals which represent the information decoding and the EH signals from the relay stations. The evaluation of the simulation results will be discussed in the final stages of the research. The outcome of this research will be the simulation results in which the estimation of the EH efficiency is evaluated based on two factors including; the number of EH subcarriers in the final receiver, and the average allocated power for EH transmission received by the final receiver.

Accelerometers are particularly suited for monitoring cow behaviors due to small size, lightweight and high accuracy. Nevertheless, the interpretation of the data collected by such sensors when characterizing the type of behaviors still brings major challenges to developers, related to activity complexity (i.e., certain behaviors contain similar gestures). This paper presents a new design of cows' behavior classifier based on acceleration data and proposed feature set. Analysis of cow acceleration data is used to extract features for classification using machine learning algorithms.

TSV-OCT: A Scalable Online Multiple-TSV Defects Localization for Real-Time 3-D-IC Systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3968/,"Dang, Nam KhanhAhmed, Akram BenAbdallah, Abderazek BenTran, Xuan TuKhanh N. Dang","In order to detect and localize TSV failures in both manufacturing and operating phases, most of the existing methods use a dedicated testing mechanism with long response time and prerequisite interruptions for on-line testing. This paper presents an ECC-based method named “Through-Silicon-Via On Communication Test” (TSV-OCT) to detect and localize faults without halting the operation of TSV-based 3D-IC systems. We ﬁrst propose Statistical Detector, a method to detect open and short defects in TSVs that work in parallel with data transactions. Second, we propose an Isolation and Check algorithm to enhance the localization ability of the method. Moreover, the Monte-Carlo simulations show that the proposed Statistical Detector increases ×2 the number of detected faults when compared to conventional ECC-based techniques. With the help of Isolation and Check, TSV-OCT localizes the number of defects up to ×4 and ×5 higher. In addition, the response time is kept below 65,000 cycles which could be easily integrated into real-time applications. On the other hand, an implementation of TSV-OCT on a 3D Network-on-Chip router shows no performance degradation for testing while having a reasonable area overhead.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Thermal distribution and reliability prediction for 3D Networks-on-Chip,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3969/,"Dang, Nam KhanhAhmed, Akram BenAbdallah, Abderazek BenTran, Xuan TuKhanh N. Dang","As one of the most promising technologies to reduce footprint, power consumption and wire latency, Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D-ICs) is considered as the near future for VLSI system. Combining with the Network-on-Chip infrastructure to obtain 3D Networks-on-Chip (3D-NoCs), the new on-chip communication paradigm brings several advantages. However, thermal dissipation is one of the most critical challenges for 3D-ICs, where the heat cannot easily transfer through several layers of silicon. Consequently, the high-temperature area also confronts the reliability threat as the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) decreases exponentially with the operating temperature as in Blackâ€™s model. Apparently, 3D-NoCs and 3D ICs must tackle this fundamental problem in order to be widely used. However, the thermal analyses usually require complicated simulation and might cost an enormous execution time. As a closed-loop design flow, designers may take several times to optimize their designs which significantly increase the thermal analyzing time. Furthermore, reliability prediction also requires both completed design and thermal prediction, and designer can use the result as a feedback for their optimization. As we can observe two big gaps in the design flow, it is difficult to obtain both of them which put 3D-NoCs under thermal throttling and reliability threats. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the thermal distribution and reliability prediction of 3D-NoCs. We first present a new method to help simulate the temperature (both steady and transient) using traffic values from realistic and synthetic benchmarks and the power consumption from standard VLSI design flow. Then, based on the proposed method, we further predict the relative reliability between different parts of the network. Experimental results show that the method has an extremely fast execution time in comparison to the acceleration lifetime test. Furthermore, we compare the thermal behavior and reliability between Monolithic design and TSV-based design. We also explore the ability to implement the thermal via a mechanism to help reduce the operating temperature.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

A thermal-aware on-line fault tolerance method for TSV lifetime reliability in 3D-NoC systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4049/,"Dang, Nam KhanhAhmed, Akram BenAbdallah, Abderazek BenTran, Xuan TuKhanh N. Dang","Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) based 3D Integrated Circuits (3D-IC) are one of the most advanced architectures by providing low power consumption, shorter wire length and smaller footprint. However, 3D-ICs confront lifetime reliability due to high operating temperature and interconnect reliability, especially the Through-Silicon-Via (TSV), which can significantly affect the accuracy of the applications. In this paper, we present an online method that supports the detection and correction of lifetime TSV failures, named IaSiG. By reusing the conventional recovery method and analyzing the output syndromes, IaSiG can determine and correct the defective TSVs. Results show that within a group, $R$ redundant TSVs can fully localize and correct $R$ defects and support the detection of $R+1$ defects. Moreover, by using $G$ groups, it can localize up to GxR and detect up to Gx(R+1) defects. An implementation of IaSiG for 32-bit data in eight groups and two redundancies has a worst-case execution time (WCET) of 5,152 cycles while supporting at most 16 defective TSVs (50\% localization). By integrating IaSiG onto a 3D Network-on-Chip, we also perform a grid-search based empirical method to insert suitable numbers of redundancies into TSV groups. The empirical method takes the operating temperature as the factor of accelerated fault due to the fact that temperature is one of the major issues of 3D-ICs. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the number of redundancies from the uniform method while still maintaining the required Mean Time to Failure.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Dang","As one of the most promising technologies to realize 3D Integrated Circuits (3D-ICs), Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) acts as the inter-layer link inside 3D Networks-on-Chip. However, the reliability issues due to the low yield rates and the sensitivity to thermal hotspots and stress issues are preventing TSV-based 3D-ICs from being widely and efficiently used. To ensure the correctness of TSV connections at run-time, detecting multiple (clustering) defects is an important feature. While Error Correction Codes are limited by a certain number of detectable faults, using Built-In-Self-Test (BIST) prevents the system from operating normally during the test time. This paper first presents a Parity Product Code (PPC) with the ability to correct one fault and detect, at least, two faults. Second, we present extended PPC (EPPC) to detect multiple defects within the links of Networks-on-Chip by using two or more additional matrices. Furthermore, we present the distance-aware version of EPPC to detect multiple defects by using only one extra matrix. The results show that the distance-aware EPPC can detect 100% of clustering defects and multiple random defects within two and three cycles, respectively. The performance evaluation for Network-on-Chip testing also shows no degradation while providing an extremely short response time (2-3 cycles).",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

The model satisfactorily reproduces meteorological fields, such as temperature 2 m above the ground and relative humidity 2 m above the ground at 45 NCHMF meteorological stations in January, but lower agreement was found in those simulations of July. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in January showed good temporal and spatial agreements to observations recorded at three CEM air monitoring stations in Phutho, Quangninh, and Hanoi, with correlation coefficients of 0.36 and 0.59.

Security and privacy are the key issues for deploying IoT applications, and still face some enormous challenges; especially, for devices that require high throughput and low latency as IoT cameras, IoT gateways, high-quality video conferencing systems… In this paper, we proposed a 10-cores AES hardware architecture to achieve high throughput.

Fully parallel, outer round pipeline technique is also used to achieve low latency.

Nonlinear Post-Buckling of CNTs Reinforced Sandwich-Structured Composite Annular Spherical Shells,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4008/,"Duong, Tuan ManhVu, Thi Thuy AnhPham, Dinh NguyenNguyen, Dinh DucProf. Dinh Duc Nguyen","This work presents the nonlinear post-buckling behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced sandwich composite annular spherical (AS) shells supported by elastic foundations in the thermal environment. This paper takes advantage of the sandwich-structured configuration with three layers: two nanocomposite face sheets and an isotropic core to analyze the static problem. Due to the precious properties, CNTs are applied to reinforce nanocomposite face sheets of AS shells. The governing equations of the nonlinear mechanical response of CNTs reinforced sandwich-structured composite (SSC) AS shells are achieved by using the classical shell theory (CST) and taking von Kármán’s geometrical nonlinearity into account. Applying Airy’s stress function and an approximate solution, we propose a form of stress function for CNTs reinforced SSC AS shells. The detailed effects of different types of CNTs’ reinforcement and volume fractions, geometrical parameters, core to face sheet thickness ratio, Winkler and Pasternak elastic foundations on the nonlinear mechanical post-buckling analysis are examined.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4008/1/S0219455420500182,Department of Civil Engineering and Transportation (CET),2020
A new constraint programming model and a linear programming-based adaptive large neighborhood search for the vehicle routing problem with synchronization constraints,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4061/,"Ha, Minh HoangNguyen, Tat DatNguyen, Duy ThinhPham, Hoang GiangDo, ThuyRousseau, Louis-MartinHà Minh Hoàng","We consider a vehicle routing problem which seeks to minimize cost subject to time window and synchronization constraints. In this problem, the fleet of vehicles is categorized into regular and special vehicles. Some customers require both vehicles’ services, whose service start times at the customer are synchronized. Despite its important real-world application, this problem has rarely been studied in the literature. To solve the problem, we propose a Constraint Programming (CP) model and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) in which the design of insertion operators is based on solving linear programming (LP) models to check the insertion feasibility. A number of acceleration techniques is also proposed to significantly reduce the computational time. The computational experiments show that our new CP model finds better solutions than an existing CP-based ALNS, when used on small instances with 25 customers and with a much shorter running time. Our LP-based ALNS dominates the CP-based ALNS, in terms of solution quality, when it provides solutions with better objective values, on average, for all instance classes. This demonstrates the advantage of using linear programming instead of constraint programming when dealing with a variant of vehicle routing problems with relatively tight constraints, which is often considered to be more favorable for CP-based methods. We also adapt our algorithm to solve a well-studied variant of the problem, and the obtained results show that the algorithm provides good solutions as state-of-the-art approaches and improves four best known solutions.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

An integrated sensing system is part of a smart building where real-time indoor air quality data are monitored round the clock using sensors and operating in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment. In this work, we propose an air quality management system merging indoor air quality index (IAQI) and humidex into an enhanced indoor air quality index (EIAQI) by using sensor data on a real-time basis. Here, indoor air pollutant levels are measured by a network of waspmote sensors while IAQI and humidex data are fused together using an extended fractional-order Kalman filter (EFKF). According to the obtained EIAQI, overall air quality alerts are provided in a timely fashion for accurate prediction with enhanced performance against measurement noise and nonlinearity. The estimation scheme is implemented by using the fractional-order modeling and control (FOMCON) toolbox.

The system is developed based on the VexRiscv Central Processing Unit (CPU) with the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions of RV32IM. Besides the core processor, the System-on-Chip (SoC) contains 8KB of boot ROM, 64KB of on-chip memory, UART controller, SPI controller, timer, and GPIOs for LEDs and switches. The 8KB of boot ROM has 7KB of hard-code in combinational logics and 1KB of a stack in SRAM. The proposed SoC performs the Dhrystone and Coremark benchmarks with the results of 1.27 DMIPS/MHz and 2.4 Coremark/MHz, respectively.

Adaptive Quantization Parameter Estimation for HEVC Based Surveillance Scalable Video Coding,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4026/,"Hoang, Van XiemDr. Xiem HoangVan","Visual surveillance systems have been playing a vital role in human modern life with a large number of applications, ranging from remote home management, public security to traffic monitoring. The recent High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) scalable extension, namely SHVC, provides not only the compression efficiency but also the adaptive streaming capability. However, SHVC is originally designed for videos captured from generic scenes rather than from visual surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a novel HEVC based surveillance scalable video coding (SSVC) framework. First, to achieve high quality inter prediction, we propose a long-term reference coding method, which adaptively exploits the temporal correlation among frames in surveillance video. Second, to optimize the SSVC compression performance, we design a quantization parameter adaptation mechanism in which the relationship between SSVC rate-distortion (RD) performance and the quantization parameter is statistically modeled by a fourth-order polynomial function. Afterwards, an appropriate quantization parameter is derived for frames at long-term reference position. Experiments conducted for a common set of surveillance videos have shown that the proposed SSVC significantly outperforms the relevant SHVC standard, notably by around 6.9% and 12.6% bitrate saving for the low delay (LD) and random access (RA) coding configurations, respectively while still providing a similar perceptual decoded frame quality.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

DungVu, C QuangNguyen, Su AnhHoàng Xuân Huấn","The Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which finds a set of k nodes (called seedset) in a social network to initiate the influence spread so that the number of influenced nodes after propagation process is maximized, is an important problem in information propagation and social network analysis. However, previous studies ignored the constraint of priority that led to inefficient seed collections. In some real situations, companies or organizations often prioritize influencing potential users during their influence diffusion campaigns. With a new approach to these existing works, we propose a new problem called Influence Maximization with Priority (IMP) which finds out a set seed of k nodes in a social network to be able to influence the largest number of nodes subject to the influence spread to a specific set of nodes U (called priority set) at least a given threshold T in this paper. We show that the problem is NP-hard under well-known IC model. To find the solution, we propose two efficient algorithms, called Integrated Greedy (IG) and Integrated Greedy Sampling (IGS) with provable theoretical guarantees. IG provides a � 1 − (1 − 1 k ) t � -approximation solution with t is an outcome of algorithm and t ≥ 1. The worst-case approximation ratio is obtained when t = 1 and it is equal to 1/k. In addition, IGS is an efficient randomized approximation algorithm based on sampling method that provides a � 1 − (1 − 1 k ) t − e � -approximation solution with probability at least 1 − δ with e > 0, δ ∈ (0, 1) as input parameters of the problem. We conduct extensive experiments on various real networks to compare our IGS algorithm to the state-of-the-art algorithms in IM problem. The results indicate that our algorithm provides better solutions interns of influence on the priority sets when approximately give twice to ten times higher than threshold T while running time, memory usage and the influence spread also give considerable results compared to the others.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Adaptive Content Frame skipping for Wyner-Ziv based Light Field Image Compression,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4201/,"Huy, Phi CongStuart, PerryXiem, HoangVanDr. Xiem HoangVan","Light field (LF) imaging introduces attractive possibilities for digital imaging, such as digital focusing, post-capture changing of the focal plane or view point, and scene depth estimation, by capturing both spatial and angular information of incident light rays. However, LF image compression is still a great challenge, not only due to light field imagery requiring a large amount of storage space and a large transmission bandwidth, but also due to the complexity requirements of various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel LF adaptive content frame skipping compression solution by following a Wyner–Ziv (WZ) coding approach. In the proposed coding approach, the LF image is firstly converted into a four-dimensional LF (4D-LF) data format. To achieve good compression performance, we select an efficient scanning mechanism to generate a 4D-LF pseudo-sequence by analyzing the content of the LF image with different scanning methods. In addition, to further explore the high frame correlation of the 4D-LF pseudo-sequence, we introduce an adaptive frame skipping algorithm followed by decision tree techniques based on the LF characteristics, e.g., the depth of field and angular information. The experimental results show that the proposed WZ-LF coding solution achieves outstanding rate distortion (RD) performance while having less computational complexity. Notably, a bit rate saving of 53% is achieved compared to the standard high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) Intra codec.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Dang","With the increasing demand for computing machines that more closely model the biological brain, the field of neuro-inspired computing has progressed to the exploration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), and to best the challenges of conventional Von Neumann architecture, several hardware-based (neuromorphic) chips have been designed. A neuromorphic chip is based on spiking neurons which process input information only when they receive spike signals. Given a sparsely-distributed input spike train, the power consumption for such event-driven hardware would be reduced since large portions of the network that are not driven by incoming spikes can be set into a powergated mode. The challenges that need to be solved toward building in hardware such a spiking neuromorphic chip with a massive number of synapse include building small-sized spiking neuro-cores with low-power consumption, efficient neurocoding scheme, and lightweight on-chip learning algorithm. In this paper, we present the hardware implementation and evaluation of a light-weight spiking neuron processing core (SNPC) for our 3DNoC SNN processor, and the design of its on-chip learning block. The SNPC embeds 256 Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons, and crossbar based synapses, covering a chip area of 0.12mm2.

Due to their complicated structures with numerous atoms in a unit cell of the garnet structure, it is difficult to predict their crystal structures accurately by the first principles calculation, especially when they include magnetic elements. It was proposed to predict the structural parameters for spinel compounds by the empirical model employing ionic radii and electronegativities, which reproduced the experimental structural parameters of spinels successfully. In the present work, we propose a comprehensive and reliable model to explain and/or predict the structural parameters of the garnet structured materials using the machine learning. The lattice parameters of 182 garnet compounds reported in the database are compiled in our dataset to train the model. Using the ionic radii and electronegativities of the constituent elements of considered garnet compounds, we constructed the linear regression model fitted to the garnets' lattice constants in the dataset.

Fractional Frequency Reuse in Multi-tier Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3935/,"Lam, Sinh CongSandrasegaran, KumbesanDr Sinh Cong Lam","Frequency Reuse (FR) is an efficient approach to improve the network performance in a multi-cell cellular network. In this paper, we investigate the performance of heterogeneous networks utilising two well-known frequency reuse algorithms, called Strict FR and Soft FR, with a reuse factor of \Delta > 1). Based on a two-phase operation of the FR algorithm, we \comment{develop} a new approach to analyse cellular networks based on the Poisson Point Process (PPP) model which successfully demonstrates the impact of the network parameters (such as the number of allocated Resource Blocks (RBs) and bias factor) and FR parameters (such as Base Station (BS) transmit power) on the performance of a user and overall network. Compared to related works, we propose the following novel approaches: (i) we investigate flexible FR networks in which users have connections with the BSs which deliver the highest performance; (ii) the BS observes SINR on the data channel to classify each user into either a Cell-Edge User (CEU) or Cell-Center User (CCU); (iii) the initial state of the network is considered to establish the initial network interference when new users arrive and request connections to the BSs. In the case of a single-tier network, it is proved that our analytical approach is more accurate than previous works. In the case of a two-tier network, the analytical results indicate that compared to the 3GPP model, our proposed model not only reduces up to 40.79% and 3.8% power consumption of a BS on the data channel but also achieves 16.08% and 18.63% higher data rates in the case of Strict FR and Soft FR respectively.

Diagnosis of polyps in colonoscopy videos is a challenging task due to variations in the size and shape of polyps. In this paper, we adapt U-net and evaluate its performance with different modern convolutional neural networks as its encoder for polyp segmentation. One of the major challenges in training networks for polyp segmentation raises when the data are unbalanced, polyp pixels are often much lower in numbers than non-polyp pixels. A trained network with unbalanced data may make predictions with high precision and low recall, being severely biased toward the non-polyp class which is particularly undesired because false negatives are more important than false positives. We propose an asymmetric similarity loss function to address this problem and achieve a much better tradeoff between precision and recall. Finally, we propose an ensemble method for further performance improvement. We evaluate the performance of well-known polyp datasets CVC-ColonDB and ETIS-Larib PolypDB. The best results are 89.13% dice, 79.77% IOU, 90.15% recall, and 86.28% precision.

Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorders. For epilepsy diagnosis or treatment, the neurologist needs to observe epileptic spikes from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Since multi-channel EEG records can be naturally represented by multi-way tensors, it is of interest to see whether tensor decomposition is able to analyze EEG epileptic spikes. Approach. In this paper, we first proposed the problem of simultaneous multilinear low-rank approximation of tensors (SMLRAT) and proved that SMLRAT can obtain local optimum solutions by using two well-known tensor decomposition algorithms (HOSVD and Tucker-ALS). Second, we presented a new system for automatic epileptic spike detection based on SMLRAT. Main results. We propose to formulate the problem of feature extraction from a set of EEG segments, represented by tensors, as the SMLRAT problem. Efficient EEG features were obtained, based on estimating the ‘eigenspikes’ derived from nonnegative GSMLRAT. We compared the proposed tensor analysis method with other common tensor methods in analyzing EEG signal and compared the proposed feature extraction method with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results indicated that our proposed method is able to detect epileptic spikes with high accuracy. Significance.

In the past few years, the number IoT devices has increased exponentially and different devices have different requirements due to heterogeneity. Hence, one computing platform is not suitable to fulfill the requirements of all IoT devices. In this case, federation of different computing paradigms comes into play where a user or a device having an account on one computing platform can access the services provided by the other computing platform, federated with the first computing platform, without having to create another account. There are multiple research problems which arise due to the federation among which authentication is the most important one. This work addresses the third-party authentication problem in federated cloud and 3GPP edge systems where a user (first party) having an account on the cloud or edge (second party) needs to access services in the edge or cloud (third party). Related studies in the literature solve these issues by proposing new protocols or by adding new components in the 3GPP system. In this study, we propose the standard-compliant third-party authentication approach, which is the combination of the existing authentication protocols in the cloud and the 3GPP network. we use a federated proxy between cloud and the 3GPP network to solve the problem of message mismatch in the authentication protocols of cloud and edge. The experimental results illustrate that, as compared with the combination of OpenID Connect and EPS-AKA, third-party authentication of edge-to-cloud and cloud-to-edge using federated proxy can reduce the authentication delay time by 27.7% and 37.9% respectively and it is also standard compliant.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Simulation study of two-dimensional viscoelastic imaging of soft tissues using the extended Kalman filter for tumor detection,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3704/,"Luong, Quang HaTran, Duc TanNguyen, Linh TrungHuynh, Huu TueDo, Ngoc MinhA/Prof. Linh Trung Nguyen","The mechanical properties of tissues in terms of elasticity and viscosity provide useful information for tumor detection. Recently, shear wave imaging has been developed to quantify tissue elasticity by estimating the parameters of the complex shear modulus (CSM). The current challenges of CSM estimation are estimation accuracy, computational complexity, and dealing with heterogeneous media. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional CSM imaging method based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Firstly, particle velocities at spatial locations are acquired by using a Doppler ultrasound system. Then, the EKF is used to estimate the CSM at each spatial point, and hence for an area of interest using ray scanning. Finally, the CSM images are also enhanced using several image processing algorithms. Simulated experiment and performance studies are carried out to confirm the quality of the proposed method.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Domain-independent intent extraction from online texts,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3677/,"Luong, Thai LeTran, Nhu ThuatDang, Tien SonTran, Quoc LongPhan, Xuan HieuA/Prof. Xuan Hieu Phan","Identifying user’s intents from texts on online channels has a wide range of applications from entrepreneurship, banking to e-commerce. However, intent identification is not a simple task due to the intent and its attributes are various and strongly depend on the domain of data. If the number of intent domains increases, the number of intent’s attributes will get bigger. As a result, the complexity of intent extraction task grows up significantly. Additionally, when a new domain comes, it involves considerable physical efforts to define specific labels for intent and attributes for that domain. Hence, it would be much better to come up with a new method for extracting user’s intents which is not dependent on a specific domain. In our research, we study the problem of domain-independent intent identification from posts and comments crawled from social networks and discussion forums. We present ten general labels, i.e. labels do not depend on a specific domain, and utilize them when extracting intent and its related information. We also propose a map between general labels and domain-specific labels. We extensively conduct experiments to explore the efficiency of using general labels compared to specific labels in extracting user’s intents when the number of intent domains increases. Our study is conducted on a medium-sized dataset from three selected domains: Tourism, Real Estate and Transportation. In term of accuracy, when the number of domains grows, our proposal achieves significantly better results than domain-specific method in identifying user's intent.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

VeRA: Verifying RBAC and authorization constraints models of web applications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4095/,"Luong, Thanh NhanTruong, Ninh ThuanProf. Ninh Thuan Truong","The software security issue is being paid great attention from the software development community as security violations have emerged variously. Developers often use access control techniques to restrict some security breaches to software systems’ resources. The addition of authorization constraints to the role-based access control model increases the ability to express access rules in real-world problems. In this paper, we introduce an approach to reviewing the implementation of these models in web applications written by JavaEE according to the MVC architecture under the support of the Spring Security framework. The proposed method helps developers detect flaws in the assignment implementation process of the models. Firstly, the approach focuses on extracting the information about users and roles from the database of the web application. We then analyze policy configuration files to establish the access analysis tree of the system. Next, algorithms are introduced to validate the correctness of implemented user - role and role - permission assignments in the application system against the role-based access control and authorization constraint specification by the SecureUML model. Lastly, we developed a tool called VeRA, to automatically support the verification process. The tool has also experimented with a number of access violation scenarios in the medical record management system.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,,School of Aerospace Engineering (SAE),2020

In particular, the Gaussian CRB (i.e., the CRB obtained assuming the data are Gaussian) corresponds to the worst case; giving the largest CRB among a large class of data distributions. This makes it very useful in practice since optimizing under the Gaussian data assumption can be interpreted as a min-max optimization (i.e., minimizing the largest CRB). The Gaussian CRB is also the corresponding bound of Second-Order Statistics (SOS)-based estimation methods, which are frequently used in practice. Despite its practicality, computing this bound might be cumbersome in some cases, particularly in the case where the input is assumed deterministic and has a large number of samples. In this paper, we address this computational issue by proposing a fast computation for the deterministic Gaussian CRB of Single-Input Multiple Output (SIMO) blind system identification. More precisely, we exploit circulant matrix properties to reduce the cost from cubic to quadratic with respect to the sample size. Moreover, we derive a closed-form formula for the asymptotic (large sample size) Gaussian CRB and show how it can be computed using the residue theorem.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

In comparison with GePVO-K method, iGePVO-K has the following advantages. First, the embedding capacity of the new method is higher than that of GePVO-K method by using data embedding formulas reasonably and reducing the location map size. Second, for embedding data, in the new method, each pixel value is modified at most by one, while in GePVO-K method, each pixel value may be modified by two. In fact, in the GePVO-K method, the largest pixels are modified by two for embedding bits 1 and by one for bits 0. This is also true for the smallest pixels. Meanwhile, in the proposed method, the largest pixels are modified by one for embedding bits 1 and are unchanged if embedding bits 0.

Aﬃliation strings of articles are transformed into the new feature space by integrating weights of features and local characteristics of words and phrases contributing to the sequences.

InGaP Nano-pattern Structure Realized by Thermally Dewetted Au Nanoparticles and Anisotropic Dry Etching,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3758/,"Nguyen, Dinh LamNguyÃªÌ�n","Abstract: Background: Optical reflection loss can be reduced more than 30% when multilayers ARC are deposited on the optoelectronic devices surface. Besides that, sub-wavelength structures, which have a period sufficiently smaller than the wavelength of light, have been introduced as an antireflection layer to offer a new possibility to suppress the Fresnel reflection. Normally, e-bean and nano-imprint lithography techniques are used to create nano-scale etch mask patterns. Metallic nanoparticles, which can be formed by a thermal dewetting process of metal thin film without any nanolithography techniques, can be utilized as an etch mask for the nano structure fabrications. The nano-patterned structures were fabricated on a silicon nitride passivation layer of a GaInP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell and showed an enhancement of its performance due to improved optical transmission and current matching. Objective: Investigate the influences of InGaP nano-pattern structures on the optical characteristics and applied for compound solar cells. Methods: In this report, disordered InGaP nano-pattern structures were formed by thermally dewetted Au nanoparticles and anisotropic dry etching processes. The effects of the InGaP nano-patterned structure on the optical reflection characteristics were investigated. Results: The result indicated that the InGaP nano-patterned structure can reduce the optical reflection in a wide range of wavelengths and, thus, can work as an antireflection layer. The InGaP nanostructure can improve up to 14.8% in the short circuit current density compared to that of the planar cell. Conclusion: The InGaP nano structures have been successfully fabricated by thermal dewetted Au nanoparticles and anisotropic dry etching methods. The fabricated Au nanoparticles pattern was found to be the best when annealing temperature is 400°C for 30 minutes with the 5nm thick of Au film. By controlling dry etching time, the height of InGaP nanostructures can be varied from 95 nm to 150 nm. With the increasing of the height, the optical reflectance can be down to 22%. The InGaP nanostructure with the height of 150 nm was also introduced to the window layer of a single junction GaAs soar cell.

A lightweight Max-Pooling method and architecture for Deep Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4244/,"Nguyen, Duy AnhTran, Xuan TuDang, Nam KhanhIacopi, FrancescaProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","The training of Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) is facing many challenges due to the non-differentiable nature of spikes. The conversion of a traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to its DSNNs counterpart is currently one of the prominent solutions, as it leverages many state-of-the-art pre-trained models and training techniques. However, the conversion of max-pooling layer is a non-trivia task. The state-of-the-art conversion methods either replace the max-pooling layer with other pooling mechanisms or use a max-pooling method based on the cumulative number of output spikes. This incurs both memory storage overhead and increases computational complexity, as one inference in DSNNs requires many timesteps, and the number of output spikes after each layer needs to be accumulated. In this paper, we propose a novel max-pooling mechanism that is not based on the number of output spikes but is based on the membrane potential of the spiking neurons. Simulation results show that our approach still preserves classification accuracies on MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset.

Second, we analyzed the source code of the ANN algorithm and proposed the optimization solution to explore its multi-level parallelism to improve the performance of the application on the CGRC platform. The computation tasks of ANN are dynamically mapped onto CGRA only when needed, and it's quite different from traditional Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) methods in which all the tasks are implemented statically.

Fuzzy extensions of DLs can be used for such domains when data and knowledge about them are vague and imprecise. One of the possible ways to specify classes of objects in such domains is to use concepts in fuzzy DLs. As DLs are variants of modal logics, indiscernibility in DLs is characterized by bisimilarity. The bisimilarity relation of an interpretation is the largest auto-bisimulation of that interpretation. In DLs and their fuzzy extensions, such equivalence relations can be used for concept learning. In this paper, we define and study fuzzy bisimulation and bisimilarity for fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics, as well as crisp bisimulation and strong bisimilarity for such logics extended with involutive negation. The considered logics are fuzzy extensions of the DL ALCreg (a variant of PDL) with additional features among inverse roles, nominals, (qualified or unqualified) number restrictions, the universal role, local reflexivity of a role and involutive negation. We formulate and prove results on invariance of concepts under fuzzy (resp. crisp) bisimulation, conditional invariance of fuzzy TBoxex/ABoxes under bisimilarity (resp. strong bisimilarity), and the Hennessy-Milner property of fuzzy (resp. crisp) bisimulation for fuzzy DLs without (resp. with) involutive negation under the Gödel semantics. Apart from these fundamental results, we also provide results on using fuzzy bisimulation to separate the expressive powers of fuzzy DLs, as well as results on using strong bisimilarity to minimize fuzzy interpretations.",Article,Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4068/1/2008.02857.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2020

The problem called “minimum k-dominating set problem” (MkDSP) becomes the classical dominating set problem if k is 1 and has important applications in monitoring large-scale social networks.

In the network under considerations, a power beacon and IoT devices(with various communication types and energy constraints) are assumed to belong to different service providers, i.e., energy service provider (ESP) and IoT service provider (ISP), respectively. To jointly maximize the utility for both service providers in terms of energy efficiency and network throughput, a Stackelberg game model is proposed to study the strategic interaction between the ISP and ESP. In particular, the ISP first evaluates its benefits from providing IoT services to its customers and then sends its requested price together with the service time to the ESP. Based on the request from the ISP, the ESP offers an optimized transmission power that maximizes its utility while meeting energy demands of the ISP. To study the Stackelberg equilibrium, we first obtain a closed-form solution for the ESP and propose a low-complexity iterative method based on block coordinate descent (BCD) to address the non-convex optimization problem for the ISP.

Dynamic Basic Activity Sequence Matching Method in Abnormal Driving Pattern Detection Using Smartphone Sensors,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3928/,"Nguyen, Thi HauLu, Dang NhacNguyen, Duc NhanNguyen, Ha NamNguyá»�n Th","In this work, we present a novel method, namely dynamic basic activity sequence matching (DAS), a combination of machine learning methods and flexible threshold based methods for distinguishing normal and abnormal driving patterns. Indeed, DAS relies on the activity detection module (ADM) presented in our previous work to analyze each driving pattern as a sequence of basic activities—stopping (S), going straight (G), turning left (L), and turning right (R). In fact, the threshold value and other parameters like the duration of long and short activities are iteratively induced from the collected dataset. Hence, DAS is flexible and independent of driving contexts such as vehicle modes and road conditions. Experimental results, on the dataset collected from numerous motorcyclists, show the outperformance of our proposed method against dynamic time warping and the two popular machine learning methods—random forest and neural network—in distinguishing the normal and abnormal driving patterns. Moreover, we propose an efficient framework composing of two phases: in the first phase, the normal and abnormal driving patterns are distinguished by relying on DAS. In the second phase, the detected abnormal patterns are further classified into various specific abnormal driving patterns—weaving, sudden braking, etc. This fusion framework again achieves the highest overall accuracy of 97.94%.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

In this paper, we propose VoglerNet, a data-driven diffraction estimator, by converting the Vogler algorithm into a deep neural network based system. To train VoglerNet, we propose to minimize a regularized loss function using Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation in conjunction with a Bayesian regularization.

Reducing Blocking Artifacts in CNN-Based Image Steganography by Additional Loss Functions,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4153/,"Pham, Tuan DungTa, Viet CuongPham, Thi Thanh ThuyLe, Thanh HaCuong Ta Viet","Our work improves the encoded image quality from HiDDeN framework, an end-to-end image steganography based on deep convolution neural network. In the encoding phase of HiDDeN framework, to embed a message in a cover image, it is required to split the cover image into smaller image blocks and embed the message bits in each block in parallel. These embedded blocks are then combined to form an encoded image that has the same size as the cover image. This image reconstruction process causes artifacts that appear on the boundaries of the blocks. This can be explained by the fact that when message bits are embedded in the image blocks, the pixel-level information of each image block is unequally alternated. In order to reduce block artifacts, in this work we propose a blocking loss as an additional objective function in HiDDeN framework. This loss measures the difference between encoded images and modified versions of the cover images. The proposed method is evaluated on COCO 2014 and BOSS datasets and the experimental results show the effectiveness in reducing the block artifacts that appeared in the encoded images of HiDDeN framework. This has an important impact on increasing the invisibility or transparency of the steganography system.

Motion-Encoded Particle Swarm Optimization for Moving Target Search Using UAVs,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4075/,"Phung, Manh DuongHa, QuangDr Manh Duong Phung","This paper presents a novel algorithm named the motion-encoded particle swarm optimization (MPSO) for finding a moving target with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). From the Bayesian theory, the search problem can be converted to the optimization of a cost function that represents the probability of detecting the target. Here, the proposed MPSO is developed to solve that problem by encoding the search trajectory as a series of UAV motion paths evolving over the generation of particles in a PSO algorithm. This motion-encoded approach allows for preserving important properties of the swarm including the cognitive and social coherence, and thus resulting in better solutions. Results from extensive simulations with existing methods show that the proposed MPSO improves the detection performance by 24\% and time performance by 4.71 times compared to the original PSO, and moreover, also outperforms other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms including the artificial bee colony (ABC), ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), and tree-seed algorithm (TSA) in most search scenarios.

The secondary users (SUs) are subject to three constraints which include peak transmit power level and interference limitation with respect to the primary user (PU) as well as secrecy outage constraints due to the EAV. Secrecy outage is achieved when the EAV cannot decode the targeted signal, but communications in the secondary network is still possible (non-zero capacity exists). Approximation expressions of the secrecy outage probability and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity are derived to evaluate the secrecy performance. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to examine the accuracy of the derived approximation expressions. Based on this, power allocation policies for the SUs are derived, satisfying all the constraints while maximizing the secrecy performance as well as the quality of service performance of the secondary network. It can be concluded that with knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of the EAV it is possible to calculate the optimal value for the secrecy outage threshold of the secondary user (SU) which in turn allows maximizing the secrecy performance. Most interestingly, our numerical results illustrate that the secrecy performance of the system is much improved when the parameters obtained using the CSI of the EAV are calculated optimally. Thence, the system can adjust the power allocation so that no eavesdropping occurs even without reducing quality of service (QoS) performance compared to a network without any EAV.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

In modern RF designs, The LNA is usually fabricated on a microstrip printed circuit board (PCB) due to its simplicity and ability of integrating flexibly with other components in a receiving circuitry unit. At frequencies lower than 6 GHz, the most prevalent substrate material for a microstrip LNA is FR-4 while at higher frequencies of over 10 GHz, it is challenging to design the LNA using this material without causing considerable losses to the RF signal. There are many works related to design microstrip LNA at high frequencies, however, the dielectric substrates used in most of them were high-cost materials for low dielectric loss. This paper introduces an LNA topology using the common, low-cost FR-4 substrate which can be operated in Ku-band for applications such as small satellites’ receivers, with the expected noise figure of lower than 1 dB, gain of around 10 dB and the return loss of around -10 dB.

In practice, both positions provided by Wi‐Fi data and relative distance provided by Bluetooth data are subject to a certain degree of noise due to the uncertainty of radio propagation in complex indoor environments. In this study, we propose and evaluate two approaches, namely Non‐temporal and Temporal ones, of collaborative positioning to combine these two cohabiting technologies to improve the tracking performance. In the Non‐temporal approach, our model establishes an error observation function in a specific interval of the Bluetooth and Wi‐Fi output. It is then able to reduce the positioning error by looking for ways to minimize the error function. The Temporal approach employs an extended error model that takes into account the time component between users’ movements. For performance evaluation, several multi‐user scenarios in an indoor environment are set up. Results show that for certain scenarios, the proposed approaches attain over 40% of improvement in terms of average accuracy",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

This paper proposes an efficient hardware implementation of a binarizer for CABAC that focuses on low area cost, low power consumption while still providing enough bins for high-throughput CABAC. On the average, the proposed design can process upto 3.5 residual syntax elements (SEs) per clock cycle at the maximum frequency of 500 MHz with an area cost of 9.45 Kgates (6.41 Kgates for the binarizer core) and power consumption of 0.239 mW (0.184 mW for the binarizer core) with NanGate 45 nm technology. It shows that our proposal achieved a high overhead-efficiency of 1.293 Mbins/Kgate/mW, much better than the other related high performance designs. In addition, our design also achieved a high power-efficiency of 8288 Mbins/mW; this is important factor for handheld applications.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

However, in temporal prediction the quantization error contributes its value as noise in the total residual information. Therefore, the residual signal of the inter-picture prediction is greater than the expected one and always differs zero value even input video contains only homogeneous frames. In this paper, we reveal negative effects of quantization errors in inter prediction and propose a video encoding scheme which is able to avoid side effects of quantization errors in the stationary parts. We propose to implement a motion detection algorithm as the first stage of video encoding to separate the video into two parts: motion and static. The motion information allows us to force residual data of non-changed part to zero and keep the residual signal of motion regularly. Beside, we design block-based filters which improve motion results and filter those results fit into block encode size well. Fixed residual data of static information permits us to pre-calculate its quantized coefficient and create a bypass encoding path for it. Experimental results with the JPEG compression (MJPEG-DPCM) showed that the proposed method produces lower bitrate than the conventional MJPEG-DPCM at the same quantization parameter and a lower computational complexity.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Zone 3, comprising of the Binh Thuan and Ninh Thuan seas, the southern part of Zone 2 (Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa), and the northern part of Zone 4 (Ba Ria and Vung Tau) are found to have the highest wind energy potential, where the annual accumulated WED is 80 GWh/km2. The ve year CF and average wind speed in Phu Quy island were 54.5% and 11 m/s, respectively. These zones, with moderate resource variation and excellent ports are the most suitable for oshore wind energy development. Zones 1 and 4 are recommended for far-oshore wind farms.

In the proposed system, the signal is transmitted directly from a source node to a destination node or sent with support of selected relay nodes. While both the source node and the destination node are powered normally, the relay nodes are powered by harvesting technique. To choose the best relay node, a selection combination method was applied at the destination node in both cases of amplify-and-forward and decodeand-forward protocols. To evaluate the system performance, the outage probability of the cooperative communications over independent identically distributed Nakagami-m was derived and analysed with arbitrary m parameter whereas this parameter was fixed to be integral value in previous research studies.

In this paper, we investigate the de- livery time performance of a cache-aided FD system, in which an edge node, operates in FD mode, serves users via wireless channels and is equipped with a cache memory. Firstly, we derive a closed-form expression for the average delivery time by taking into account the uncertainties of both backhaul and access wireless channels. The derived analysis allows the examination of the impact of the key parameters, e.g., cache size and transmit power. Secondly, a power optimization problem is formulated to minimize the average delivery time. To deal with the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm based on the bisection method.

On three soft rectangle packing problems with guillotine constraints,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3509/,"Bui, Quoc TrungVidal, ThibautHa, Minh HoangHà Minh Hoàng","We investigate how to partition a rectangular region of length L1 and height L2 into n rectangles of given areas (a1,…,an) using two-stage guillotine cuts, so as to minimize either (i) the sum of the perimeters, (ii) the largest perimeter, or (iii) the maximum aspect ratio of the rectangles. These problems play an important role in the ongoing Vietnamese land-allocation reform, as well as in the optimization of matrix multiplication algorithms. We show that the first problem can be solved to optimality in O(nlogn) , while the two others are NP-hard.

Compared to brushed DC motors, BLDCM offer improved reliability, longer life, smaller size, and lower weight. Besides, BLDCM have become more popular in applications where efficiency is a critical concern and, generally speaking, a BLDCM is considered to be a high-performance motor capable of providing large amounts of torque over a wide speed range. In this paper, a research on sensorless control method which can drive a BLDCM smoothly from standstill to high speeds without position or speed sensors is carried out. Initial rotor position as well as speed of motor at a low speed range is estimated based on the inductance variation principle while at higher speed, the back EMF technique is applied.

A Novel Consistent Quality Driven for JEM based Distributed Video Coding,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3455/,"Dinh, Trieu DuongPhi, Cong HuyHoang, Van XiemDr. Xiem HoangVan","Distributed video coding (DVC) is an attractive and promising solution for low complexity constrained video applications, such as wireless sensor networks or wireless surveillance systems. In DVC, the visual quality consistency is one of the most important issues to evaluate the performance of a DVC codec. However, it is the fact that the quality of the decoded frames achieved in most recent DVC codecs is not consistent and it is varied with high quality fluctuation. To solve the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel DVC solution named JEM based DVC (JEM-DVC), which can provide not only higher performance compared to the traditional DVC solutions but also effective scheme for the quality consistency control. In the proposed JEM-DVC solution, we first employ several advanced techniques provided in the Joint exploration model (JEM) of the future video coding standard (FVC) to effectively improve the performance of JEM-DVC codec. Then, for consistent quality control, we propose two novel methods named key frame quantization (KF-Q) and Wyner-Zip frame quantization (WZF-Q) which determine the optimal values of quantization parametter (QP) and quantization matrix (QM) applied for the key and WZ frame coding, respectively. Unlike the conventional approaches, the optimal values of QP and QM are adaptively controlled and updated for every key and WZ frames to guarantee the consistent video quality for the proposed codec. Our proposed JEM-DVC is the first DVC codec in literature employing JEM coding technique, then all results presented in this paper are new. Experimental results show that the proposed JEM-DVC significantly outperforms the relevant DVC benchmarks, notably the DISCOVER DVC and the recent H.265/HEVC based DVC, in terms of both Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance and consistent visual quality.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Removing Long Echo Delay Using Combination of Jitter Buffer and Adaptive Filter,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3440/,"Dinh Van, PhongNguyen The, HieuNguyen Huy, TinhDinh Viet, QuanTran Duc, TanAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Echo in telephone transmission systems is a serious problem. It affects and distorts the desired speech. Echo cancellation methods have studied for a few decades and standardized in ITU G.168. The core theory in echo cancellation methods is using an adaptive filter which uses one of these algorithms: LMS (least mean square), NLMS (normalized least mean square), RLS (Recursive least squares), etc to remove the echo. In fixed conditions, these algorithms are efficient to remove echo. However, in some real telecom environments, with long echo delays, we must increase the filter length to a big value. But, it's not efficient in performance due to high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a solution that uses a jitter buffer along with an adaptive filter to compensate long echo delays. This solution demonstrated its efficiency in Viettel Network-the biggest telecom provider in Vietnam-both on voice quality and system performance.",Conference or Workshop Item (Lecture),Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3440/1/p99-phong.pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2019

Lagrangian Vortex Particle Method for Complex Flow Simulation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3618/,"Duong, Viet DungLavi Rizki, ZuhalHari, MuhammadDuong Viet Dung","In order to solve complicated simulation problem for complex deforming objects under complicated motions found in aerospace, aerodynamic, meteorology, biology engineering, this paper presents Lagrangian vortex method based on Brinkman penalization. The Brinkman penalization acts as an external force, which is implicitly enforced into Navier-Stokes equation in the velocity-vorticity form. The advantage of the method is the capability to remove the pressure factor which causes errors in other numerical methods due to the complexity of shape of the object. Furthermore, the method is able to model the complex geometry, complex motions as well as 3D deformation of the object. In particular, the Navier-stokes equation can be solved in a classical strategy: applying Bio-Savart law formula is to deal with the convection process; employing fast multipole method to accelerate the velocity computation.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown their effectiveness in medical image segmentation in general and also in liver segmentation. However, liver image quality may vary between medical centers due to differences in the use of CT scanners, protocols, radiation dose, and contrast enhancement. In this paper, we investigate three wells known CNNs, FCN-CRF, DRIU, and V-net, for liver segmentation using data from several medical centers. We perform qualitative evaluation of the CNNs based on Dice score, Hausdorff distance, mean surface distance and false positive rate. The results show that all three CNNs achieved a mean Dice score of over 90% in liver segmentation with typical contrast enhanced CT images of the liver. p-values from paired T-test on Dice score of the three networks using Mayo dataset are larger than 0.05 suggesting that no statistical significant difference in their performance. DRIU performs the best in term of processing time. The results also demonstrate that those CNNs have reduced performance in liver segmentation in the case of low-dose and non-contrast enhanced CT images.

The premise of caching technique is to prefetch most popular contents closer to end users in local cache of edge nodes, e.g., base station (BS). When a user requests a content that is available in the cache, it can be served directly without being sent from the core network. In this paper, we investigate the performance of hierarchical caching systems, in which both BS and end users are equipped with a storage memory. In particular, we propose a novel cooperative caching scheme that jointly optimizes the content placement at the BS’s and users’ caches.

An Enhanced Semantic-based Cache Replacement Algorithm for Web Systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3837/,"Hoang, Xuan TungBui, Ngoc DungXuan-Tung Hoang","As Web traffics is increasing on the Internet, caching solutions for Web systems are becoming more important since they can greatly expand system scalability. An important part of a caching solution is cache replacement policy, which is responsible for selecting victim items that should be removed in order to make space for new objects. Typical replacement policies used in practice only take advantage of temporal reference locality by removing the least recently/frequently requested items from the cache. Although those policies work well in memory or filesystem cache, they are inefficient for Web systems since they do not exploit semantic relationship between Web items. This paper presents a semantic-aware caching policy that can be used in Web systems to enhance scalability. The proposed caching mechanism defines semantic distance from a web page to a set of pivot pages and use the semantic distances as a metric for choosing victims. Also, it use a function-based metric that combines access frequency and cache item size for tie-breaking. Our simulations show that out enhancements outperform traditional methods in terms of hit rate, which can be useful for websites with many small and similar-in-size web objects.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3837/1/fsa-camready.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2019

Finding Relevant Files for Bug Reports Based on Mean Reciprocal Rank Maximization Approach,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3724/,"Le, Duc-TrongDuc Trong Le","Constructing and maintaining open source projects is not an easy work. Developers usually need to tackle a lot of bugs reported by users. The first step of the fixing progress is to find all relevant files respect to given reports. This step takes time and human resources. Motivating from this context, various learning-to-rank models were proposed in order to automatically rank files and generate suggestions for developers. The actual related files are expected to be appeared in high positions of the ranking. In the scope of this paper, a mean reciprocal rank optimization approach is investigated for the learning-to-rank relevant files for bug re- ports task. Given a bug report, the ranking of a source file is approximated by a function aggregating features which represent their relationship. The weights of these features are learned previously to maximize the mean reciprocal rank of known relevant files on training bug reports. In the ex- perimental section, the introduced model is evaluated on three Java open source projects namely Tomcat, AspectJ and SWT.

Correlation-Sensitive Next-Basket Recommendation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3707/,"Le, Duc-TrongLauw, Hady W.Fang, YuanDuc Trong Le","Items adopted by a user over time are indicative of the underlying preferences. We are concerned with learning such preferences from observed sequences of adoptions for recommendation. As multiple items are commonly adopted concurrently, e.g., a basket of grocery items or a sitting of media consumption, we deal with a sequence of baskets as input, and seek to recommend the next basket. Intuitively, a basket tends to contain groups of related items that support particular needs. Instead of recommending items independently for the next basket, we hypothesize that incorporating information on pairwise correlations among items would help to arrive at more coherent basket recommendations. Towards this objective, we develop a hierarchical network architecture codenamed Beacon to model basket sequences. Each basket is encoded taking into account the relative importance of items and correlations among item pairs. This encoding is utilized to infer sequential associations along the basket sequence.

Simultaneous tensor decomposition for EEG epileptic spike detection,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3444/,"Le, Trung ThanhNguyen, Thi Anh DaoNguyen, Viet DungNguyen, Linh TrungAbed-Meraim, KarimA/Prof. Linh Trung Nguyen","Objective: Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorders. For epilepsy diagnosis or treatment, the neurologist needs to observe epileptic spikes from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Since multi-channel EEG records can be naturally represented by multi-way tensors, it is of interest to see whether tensor decomposition is able to analyze EEG epileptic spikes. Approach: In this report, we first proposed the problem of simultaneous multilinear low-rank approximation of tensors (SMLRAT) and proved that SMLRAT can obtain local optimum solutions by using two well-known tensor decomposition algorithms (HOSVD and Tucker-ALS). Second, we presented a new system for automatic epileptic spike detection based on SMLRAT. Main results: We compared the proposed tensor analysis method with other common tensor methods in analyzing EEG signal and compared the proposed feature extraction method with Phan’s method. Experimental results indicated that our proposed method is able to detect epileptic spikes with good performance. Significance: To suitably deal with EEG spikes, we developed a local solution for nonnegative SMLRAT. For practical implementation, we proposed the generalized SMLRAT algorithm to effectively solve the SMLRAT and nonnegative SMLRAT problems. An efficient EEG feature extraction framework was proposed, based on estimating the “eigenspikes” from the nonnegative generalized SMLRAT algorithm.",Technical Report (Technical Report),UET-AVITECH-2019002,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3444/1/EEG_Ten_Technical_Report_Final.pdf,"Electronics and Communications

Outliers residing in the observed data are first detected in an efficient way and removed by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solver. The underlying subspace is then updated by the algorithm of parallel estimation and tracking by recursive least squares (PETRELS) in which each row of the subspace matrix was estimated in parallel. Based on PETRELS-ADMM, we also derive an efficient way for robust matrix completion. Performance studies show the superiority of PETRELS-ADMM as compared to the state-ofthe-art algorithms.

Since outliers and missing data are ubiquitous and more common in big data regime, robust variants of subspace tracking (RST) are crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely PETRELSADMM, to improve RST performance in such scenario. The proposed approach consists of two main stages, including outlier rejection and subspace estimation. In the first stage, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solver is used to detect outliers residing in the observed data in an efficient way. In the second stage, we propose a modification of the parallel estimation and tracking by recursive least squares (PETRELS) algorithm to update the underlying subspace.

Semi-supervised Convolutional Neural Networks for Flood Mapping using Multi-modal Remote Sensing Data,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3582/,"Luu, Viet HungDao, Minh SonNguyen, Thi Nhat ThanhPerry, StuartZettsu, KojiLÆ°u Viá»�t HÆ°ng","When floods hit populated areas, quick detection of flooded areas is crucial for initial response by local government, residents, and volunteers. Space-borne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) is an authoritative data sources for flood mapping since it can be acquired immediately after a disaster even at night time or cloudy weather. Conventionally, a lot of domain specific heuristic knowledge has been applied for PolSAR flood mapping, but their performance still suffers from confusing pixels caused by irregular reflections of radar waves. Optical images are another data source that can be used to detect flooded areas due to their high spectral correlation with the open water surface. However, they are often affected by day, night, or severe weather conditions (i.e., cloud). This paper presents a convolution neural network (CNN) based multimodal approach utilizing the advantages of both PolSAR and optical images for flood mapping. First, reference training data is retrieved from optical images by manual annotation. Since clouds may appear in the optical image, only areas with a clear view of flooded or non-flooded are annotated. Then, a semisupervised polarimetric features-aided CNN is utilized for flood mapping using PolSAR data. The proposed model not only can handle the issue of learning with incomplete ground truth but also can leverage a large portion of unlabelled pixels for learning. Moreover, our model takes the advantages of expert knowledge on scattering interpretation to incorporate polarimetric-features as the input. Experiments results are given for the flood event that occurred in Sendai, Japan, on 12th March 2011. The experiments show that our framework can map flooded area with high accuracy (F1=96.12) and outperform conventional flood mapping methods.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Aerospace Engineering

Given that based on ‘spatial pyramid’ of the histogram of local features, the final feature vectors not only count the multiplicity of ‘words’ but also represent their spatial topology. We attempt to improve the performance of this model by introducing augmented data for training phase. Our aim is to make the dataset big enough to be able to capture holistic variation of ship orientation. Three data augmentation operations are used including random rotate by an angle of modulo 90°, random flip-left-right, and random flip-top-bottom. Through this procedure, our trained SP-BoW model is able to get better generalization. The proposed approach is validated on the High-Resolution Ship Collections 2016 (HRSC2016) ship dataset. The results indicate that training on augmented data can significantly improve the performance of SP-BoW.

Surprisingly, we also found that the choice of a post-processing algorithm correlates strongly with the performance of the corresponding method. We expect this paper would serve as a reference for researchers as well as application developers in the field.

The influences of PbS coating layers on characteristics of GaAs single junction solar cells were investigated through I-V characteristic measurements, optical reflectance spectra, and quantum efficiencies. The results indicated that, the short-circuit current can be improved up to 15% with two PbS coating layers. Other parameters such as Voc and FF are hardly affected by the number of PbS coating layers.

Estimation of Air Temperature Using Smartphones in Different Contexts,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3613/,"Nguyen, Hai ChauHải Châu Nguyễn","Measuring air temperature at a high spatial resolution is very important for many applications including detection of urban heat islands. However, air temperature is currently measured by weather stations those are very sparse spatially. In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate air temperature using smartphones in different contexts. Most of the smartphones are not equipped with air temperature sensors but they are all equipped with battery temperature sensors. When a smartphone is in idle state, its battery temperature is stable and correlated with ambient air temperature. Furthermore, it is often carried close to human body, e.g. in pockets of coats, trousers and in hand. Therefore we developed a new approach of using two linear regression models to estimate air temperature from the idle smartphones battery temperature given their in-pocket or out-of-pocket positions. Lab test results show that the new approach is better than an existing one in mean absolute error and coefficient of determination metrics. Advantages of the new approach include the simplicity of implementation on smartphones and the ability for creating maps of temperature distribution.

Topology Optimization for Heterogeneous DHT- Based Multicast,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3448/,"Nguyen, Hoai SonHoai Son Nguyen","Since the deployment of IP multicast remains restricted due to many practical and political issues, researchers have shifted focus to exploiting application-layer multicast for multicast data delivery. Recently there has been considerable interest in applying DHT routing algorithms to application-level multicast. However, early DHT-based multicast protocols are insufficient in addressing a number of technical issues such as heterogeneous capacity of nodes or node churn. In this chapter, the author describes a solution called BAM-Chord (i.e., Bandwidth Adaptive Multicast over Chord) that optimizes the topology of a multicast tree based on node bandwidth. In the proposed solution, node position (i.e., node identifier) on a BAM-Chord ring will be decided based on node bandwidth capacity such that it can build a wide and balanced multicast tree rooted at the source node. As a result, BAM-Chord protocol can utilize network resources of every node to reduce the depth of the multicast tree and take advantages of DHTs in maintaining the multicast tree.",Book Section,"Information Technology (IT)

First, the router supports a hybrid packet-switching architecture that is dynamically reconfigurable to exchange between wormhole and virtual cut-through switching schemes at run-time. Therefore, it reaches a higher average performance than wormhole switching, while decreasing the implementation cost in comparison with the virtual cut-through switching. Second, the router is equipped a Quality-of-Services (QoS)-driven arbiter. Therefore, the proposed solution not only guarantees the guaranteed-throughput service without reserving resources but also enhances the average performance for the best-effort service by using network resources efficiently based on the priority inheritance arbitration mechanism. Third, the router is enhanced with the dynamically deadline-aware rerouting mechanism. In contention situation, the router can configure the routing computation unit to reroute the packet to another path so as to reduce the waiting interval of the blocked packets. The router was designed at the Register Transfer Level and modeled using VHDL language and then synthesized with Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA technology.

However, they can be detected at the lower 10-4 M conc., even up to of 10-9 M conc. when their deposition on a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) surface. In this paper, a SERS surface was prepared gold nano-particles (AuNPs) of 5nm diameter, synthesized from the HAuCl4 precursor and then was arranged as a SERS/AuNP- layer of 25nm in thickness. A Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) dye-indicator, chosen as the SERS-probe molecules to detect the enhanced Raman amplitude, was diluted at different solution, ranging from 10-4 M to 10-9M conc. With the same 10-4 M conc. of Rh6G dye, typical Raman peaks of the Rh6G deposited on the AuNPs surface can be clearly detected while these peaks of Rh6G on a blank glass surface could not be seen. Even if, the Rh6G solution on the AuNP surface was diluted up to 10-9M conc. its typical peaks can be still detected clearly. The significant enhancement of the surface Raman signals at the different conc. of the Rh6G solution, deposited on AuNP surface, will be later discussed in the paper.",Article,"Gold nano-particles (AuNPs), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G).",https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3690/1/Nguyen%20Kien%20Cuong%20VJS-UET-VNU%202019.doc,Engineering Physics,2019
Bisimulation and bisimilarity for fuzzy description logics under the Gödel semantics,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3551/,"Nguyen, Linh AnhHa, Quang ThuyNguyen, Ngoc ThanhNguyen, Thi Hong KhanhTran, Thanh LuongHà Quang Thụy","Description logics (DLs) are a suitable formalism for representing knowledge about domains in which objects are described not only by attributes but also by binary relations between objects. Fuzzy extensions of DLs can be used for such domains when data and knowledge about them are vague and imprecise. One of the possible ways to specify classes of objects in such domains is to use concepts in fuzzy DLs. As DLs are variants of modal logics, indiscernibility in DLs is characterized by bisimilarity. The bisimilarity relation of an interpretation is the largest auto-bisimulation of that interpretation. In DLs and their fuzzy extensions, such equivalence relations can be used for concept learning. In this paper, we define and study fuzzy bisimulation and bisimilarity for fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics, as well as crisp bisimulation and strong bisimilarity for such logics extended with involutive negation. The considered logics are fuzzy extensions of the DL (a variant of PDL) with additional features among inverse roles, nominals, (qualified or unqualified) number restrictions, the universal role, local reflexivity of a role and involutive negation. We formulate and prove results on invariance of concepts under fuzzy (resp. crisp) bisimulation, conditional invariance of fuzzy TBoxes/ABoxes under bisimilarity (resp. strong bisimilarity), and the Hennessy-Milner property of fuzzy (resp. crisp) bisimulation for fuzzy DLs without (resp. with) involutive negation under the Gödel semantics. Apart from these fundamental results, we also provide results on using fuzzy bisimulation to separate the expressive powers of fuzzy DLs, as well as results on using strong bisimilarity to minimize fuzzy interpretations.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

UV-Vis spectra of the composite films showed that ZnO exhibited a suitable buffer layer that could block holes movement throughout the heterojunction of ITO/ZnO. The enhancement in the fill factor (FF) of the buffer-OSC (BOSC) is attributed to the presence of nanoheterojunctions of ZnO/PCBM and ZnO/ITO. For the normal temperature, the increase of the open-circuit potential and short-circuit current resulted in an overall increase of the energy conversion efficiency.

In particular, we consider a low-power communication network in which the IoT devices can harvest energy from a dedicated RF energy source to support their transmissions or backscatter the signals of the RF energy source to transmit information to the gateway. Different IoT devices may have dissimilar hardware configurations, and thus they may have various communications types and energy requirements. In addition, the RF energy source may have a limited energy supply source which needs to be minimized. Thus, to maximize the network throughput, we need to jointly optimize energy usage and operation time for the IoT devices under different energy demands and communication constraints. However, this optimization problem is non-convex due to the strong relation between energy supplied by the RF energy source and the IoT communication time, and thus obtaining the optimal solution is intractable. To address this problem, we study the relation between energy supply and communication time, and then transform the non-convex optimization problem to an equivalent convex-optimization problem which can achieve the optimal solution. Through simulation results, we show that our solution can achieve greater network throughputs (up to five times) than those of other conventional methods, e.g., TDMA. In addition, the simulation results also reveal some important information in controlling energy supply and managing low-power IoT devices in heterogeneous wireless communication networks.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications > Communications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3683/1/Nguyen-ICC2019.pdf,"Advanced Insitute of Engineering and Technology (AVITECH)

A drawback of X-ray CT imaging is that the X-rays are harmful with high-dose. Reducing the X-ray dose can reduce the risks but introduce noise and artifacts in the reconstructed image. This paper presents a method, called FD-VGG for denoising of low-dose CT images. FD-VGG estimates the normal-dose image from a low-dose image and, hence, reduces noise and artifacts. In FD-VGG the loss function is defined by the combination of the mean square error(MSE) and perception loss. FD-VGG was trained on a dataset of 226200 low-dose and normal dose image pairs from 6 patients and evaluated on 100 low-dose images from 2 other patients. The corresponding normal dose images of these testing low-dose images are considered as standard images for quantitative evaluation. Two metrics namely PSNR, SSIM were used for objective evaluation.

The risk of high X-ray radiation may induce genetic, cancerous and other diseases, demanding the development of new image processing methods that are able to enhance the quality of low-dose CT images. However, lowering the radiation dose increases the noise in acquired images and hence affects important diagnostic information. This paper contributes an efficient denoising method for low-dose CT images. A noisy image is decomposed into three component images of low, medium and high frequency bands; noise is mainly presented in the medium and high component images. Then, by exploiting the fact that a small image patch of the noisy image can be approximated by a linear combination of several elements in a given dictionary of noise-free image patches generated from noise-free images taken at nearly the same position with the noisy image, noise in these medium and high component images are effectively eliminated. Specifically, we give new solutions for image decomposition to easily control the filter parameters, for dictionary construction to improve the effectiveness and reduce the running-time. Instead of using a large dataset of patches, only a structured small part of patches extracted from the raw data is used to form a dictionary, to be used in sparse coding. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving image details which are subtle but clinically important. Experimental results conducted on both synthetic and real noise data demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

QASA: Advanced Document Retriever for Open-Domain Question Answering by Learning to Rank Question-Aware Self-Attentive Document Representations,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3474/,"Nguyen, Thi Minh TrangTran, Van LienCan, Duy CatHa, Quang ThuyVu, Thi LyChng, Eng SiongHà Quang Thụy","For information consumers, being able to obtain a short and accurate answer for a query is one of the most desirable features. This motivation, along with the rise of deep learning, has led to a boom in open-domain Question Answering (QA) research. While the problem of machine comprehension has received multiple success with the help of large training corpora and the emergence of attention mechanism, the development of document retrieval in open-domain QA is lagged behind. In this work, we propose a novel encoding method for learning question-aware self-attentive document representations. By applying pair-wise ranking approach to these encodings, we build a Document Retriever, called QASA, which is then integrated with a machine reader to form a complete open-domain QA system.

We investigated spatiotemporal variation and data quality of two global satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products derived from MODIS and VIIRS imagery. AOD is considered an essential atmospheric parameter strongly related to ground Particulate Matter (PM) in Southeast Asia (SEA). We analyze seasonal variation, urban/rural area influence, and biomass burning effects on atmospheric pollution. Validation indicated a strong relationship between AERONET ground AOD and both MODIS AOD (R2 = 0.81) and VIIRS AOD (R2 = 0.68). The monthly variation of satellite AOD and AERONET AOD reflects two seasonal trends of air quality separately for mainland countries including Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan, Hong Kong, and for maritime countries consisting of Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and Timor Leste. The mainland SEA has a pattern of monthly AOD variation in which AODs peak in March/April, decreasing during wet season from May–September, and increasing to the second peak in October. However, in maritime SEA, AOD concentration peaks in October. The three countries with the highest annual satellite AODs are Singapore, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. High urban population proportions in Singapore (40.7%) and Hong Kong (21.6%) were associated with high AOD concentrations as expected. AOD values in SEA urban areas were a factor of 1.4 higher than in rural areas, with respective averages of 0.477 and 0.336. The AOD values varied proportionately to the frequency of biomass burning in which both active fires and AOD peak in March/April and September/October. Peak AOD in September/October in some countries could be related to pollutant transport of Indonesia forest fires. This study analyzed satellite aerosol product quality in relation to AERONET in SEA countries and highlighted framework of air quality assessment over a large, complicated region.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

To deal with knowledge merging problems, several approaches have been put forward. However, in the proposed models, each original probabilistic knowledge base (PKB) is represented by a set of probabilistic functions fulfilling such knowledge base. The drawbacks of the solutions are that the output of model is also a set of probabilistic functions satisfying the resulting PKB and there is no algorithm for implementing the merging process of PKBs in which each of them consists of probabilistic constraints. In this paper, distance-based approach is utilized to propose a new method of merging PKBs to ensure that both the input and output of methods are represented by sets of probabilistic constraints. To this aim, the relationship between the probability rules and the probabilistic constraints, and the several transformation methods for the representation of the original PKB are presented, a set of merging operators (MOs) is proposed, and several desirable logical properties are investigated and discussed. Several algorithms for merging PKBs are presented and the computational complexities of these algorithms are also analyzed and evaluated.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

This paper presents work on a system for tracking multiple football players in video streams. The challenges of the task are: the players are relatively small in the video with chaos movements; the processing time is efficient to ensure the analyzed data is reported during the match while the accuracy is required to be sufficient; the hardware of the system needs to be high mobility. To overwhelm those, we apply Efficient Convolution Operators (ECO) as a core tracking method to track the targets on two synchronized laptops, then the data is merged in a post-processing stage. Besides, user interactive functions are also provided to assist the operators to correct failed tracks. The tracking method is qualitatively evaluated on videos from professional football matches with two resolution settings. The number of user interactions to correct the failed tracks and the time processing are chosen as criteria for the evaluation. The results show that ECO tracking outperforms several well-known tracking methods with less than 1 tracking loss in 2 minutes on average with processing rate of 12-17 fps.

A Novel Independently Biased 3-Stack GaN HEMT Configuration for Efficient Design of Microwave Amplifiers,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3445/,"Nguyen Huy, HoangLuong Duy, ManhBach Gia, DuongBạch Gia Dương","Abstract: The power amplifier (PA) and low-noise amplifier (LNA) are the most critical components of transceiver systems including radar, mobile communications, satellite communications, etc. While the PA is the key component of the transmitter (TX), the LNA is the key component of the receiver (RX) of the transceiver system. It is pointed out that traditional design approaches for both the LNA and PA face challenging drawbacks. When designing an LNA, the power gain and noise figure of the LNA are difficult to improve simultaneously. For PA design, it indicates that efficiency and linearity of the PA are also hard to improve simultaneously. This study aims to surmount this by proposing a novel independently biased 3-stack GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) configuration for efficient design of both PA and LNA for next generation wireless communication systems. By employing an independently biased technique, the proposed configuration can offer superior performance at both small-signal (SS) for LNA design and large-signal (LS) for PA design compared with other typical circuit configurations. Simulation results show that by utilizing an adaptive bias control of each transistor of the proposed configuration, both power gain and noise figure can be improved simultaneously for the LNA design. Moreover, efficiency and linearity can be also improved at the same time for the PA design. Compared results with other typical configurations including a single-stage, conventional cascode, independentlybiasedcascode,andconventional3-stackrevealsthattheproposedconfigurationexhibits superior advantages at both SS and LS operation.

Flexible deployment of component-based distributed applications on the Cloud and beyond,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3442/,"Pham, Manh LinhNguyen, Truong ThangDr. Mạnh Linh Phạm","In an effort to minimize operational expenses and supply users with more scalable services, distributed applications are actually going towards the Cloud. These applications, sent out over multiple environments and machines, are composed by inter-connecting independently developed services and components. The implementation of such programs on the Cloud is difficult and generally carried out either by hand or perhaps by composing personalized scripts. This is extremely error prone plus it has been found that misconfiguration may be the root of huge mistakes. We introduce AutoBot, a flexible platform for modeling, installing and (re)configuring complex distributed cloud-based applications which evolve dynamically in time. AutoBot includes three modules: A simple and new model describing the configuration properties and interdependencies of components; a dynamic protocol for the deployment and configuration ensuring appropriate resolution of these interdependencies; a runtime system that guarantee the proper configuration of the program on many virtual machines and, if necessary, the reconfiguration of the deployed system. This reduces the manual application deployment process that is monotonous and prone to errors. Some validation experiments were conducted on AutoBot in order to ensure that the proposed system works as expected. We also discuss the opportunity of reusing the platform in the transition of applications from Cloud to Fog computing.",Article,"Application deployment, dynamic reconfiguration, distributed application, cloud computing, fog computing",https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3442/1/TIIS%20Vol%2013%2C%20No%203-2.pdf,"Information Technology (IT)

A Benchmarking Tool for Elastic MQTT Brokers in IoT Applications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3588/,"Pham, Manh LinhNguyen, Truong ThangTran, Manh DongDr. Mạnh Linh Phạm","Cloud computing is an evolution in IT consumption and delivery which makes available self-management on the Internet with a flexible, pay-as-you-go business model. Within the context of Internet of Things, the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol that is implemented broadly by the applications of “Publish-Subscribe” paradigm has a vital role. However, MQTT brokers are saturated easily if they have to cope with huge and speedy data generated by IoT “chatty” devices. With capability of provisioning/deprovisioning granular virtual resources, Cloud computing empowered MQTT brokers by enabling its elasticity feature. Elasticity helps the brokers deal with a very large variety of data integrated into the IoT every single day. However, there was lack of sturdy benchmarking tools that judge all the aspects of MQTT brokers in order to advocate correct elastic decision-making. This article focuses on the work of benchmarking MQTT by introducing a new developed tool called MQTTBrokerBench. With this tool, users not only can benchmark MQTT brokers but also can specify saturation points where the IoT load makes the brokers be saturated. Those saturation points can be used to set thresholds for elastic decision-making. Furthermore, the article also demonstrates the results acquired by this tool through the experiments on Windows Azure Cloud Platform.",Article,"Benchmarking, MQTT, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things",https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3588/1/10.11648.j.ijics.20190404.11.pdf,Information Technology (IT),2019

Enhancing the stress test ECG signal for real-time QRS detector,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3866/,"Pham, Manh ThangHoang, Van ManhDang, Anh VietVan Manh Hoang","The Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, which is a record of the electrical activity of the heart, can be treated as a combination of a free-noise signal and noises. The primary source of interference in the ECG recording during exercise is broadband myopotentials (EMG), contained in a full frequency band. Because the frequency ranges of both signals (ECG and EMG) overlap, band-stop filters distort the ECG signal, especially of QRS complexes. An alternative method of removing interference may be using Adaptive Wavelet Wiener Filter (AWWF) with noise-free signal estimation. As a result of a straightforward wavelet transform, it is possible to extract noise with some components of the QRS complex in the highest frequency bands. The central part of the QRS components is in the lower frequency bands. The resulting signal can be filtered by matching the transform coefficients. Testing was performed on muscle (EMG) artifact noised signals from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database at 360 Hz sampling frequency.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3866/1/Enhancing%20the%20stress%20test%20ECG%20signal%20for%20real-time%20QRS%20detector.pdf,Faculty of Engineering Mechanics and Automation (FEMA),2019

The subjective image quality scores gathered from all subjects are processed to be the mean opinion score (MOS), which is regarded as the ground truth of image quality. Due to the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is differently sensitive to features of image patch, a novel coding distortion modelling method for local image perception is proposed in this paper.

Rapid Assessment of Flood Inundation and Damaged Rice Area in Red River Delta from Sentinel 1A Imagery,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3600/,"Phan, AnhHa, Nhat DuongMan, Duc ChucBui, Quang HungNguyen, Thi Nhat ThanhNguyen, Thanh ThuyPhan Anh","The Red River Delta (RRD), including 11 provinces, is one of the four largest rice-growing areas in Vietnam. Tropical storms often occur and cause serious flooding from May to October annually in the RRD, which strongly affects the productivity of the summer–autumn rice, one of two main rice crops. Therefore, the rapid assessment of damaged rice area by flooding inundation is critical for farmers and the government. In this study, we proposed a methodology for quick estimation of rice areas damaged by flooding using Sentinel 1A (S1A) imagery. Firstly, the latest rice map was produced. Then, a Near Real-Time (NRT) flood map, which is estimated from S1A images at the closest time to a flooding event, was generated by excluding the yearly permanent map from the temporal water map. Our experiment was conducted for the assessment of damaged rice area by flooding from the tropical storm named Son-Tinh, which happened on 19–21 July 2018. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was applied on time-series of S1A VV with VH data (VVVH) to obtain a rice map for the winter-spring season of 2018 with 90.5% Overall Accuracy (OA) and 2.37% difference (12,544 ha) from the General Statistics Office (GSO) of Vietnam’s reports for the whole region. Then, the Otsu thresholding method was applied for permanent water surface extraction and NRT flood mapping. The estimated damaged area was compared to available provincial and communal statistics for validation and further analysis. Right after the Son-Tinh storm, the estimation of inundated rice was approximately 50% of the total rice area in the RRD (271,092 ha). As a result, rice damage level strongly corresponds to the inundation period. In addition, the rice-flooding frequency map over the RRD was estimated to show rice fields suffering a high risk of flooding during the rainy season in the RRD. Our experiment’s results highlight the potential of using Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for fast monitoring and assessment of paddy rice areas affected by flooding at a large scale in the RRD region",Article,"Aerospace Engineering

The area, alone, can provide the 38.2 GW power generation capacity corresponding to the increasing renewable-energy demand by 2030 planned by the country. There is also a drawback of the wind resource, which is associated with strong multiple-scale temporal variabilities. The seasonal variability associated with monsoon onsets and daily variability associated with the wind diurnal cycles were found ranging 30-50%. Meanwhile, the inter-annual variability could reach up to 10%. These variabilities must be considered when designing wind farms and grids over the region.

Light Intensity-dependent Variation in Defect Contributions to Charge Transport and Recombination in a Planar MAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cell,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3915/,"Ryu, ShinyoungNguyen, Duc CuongHa, Na YoungPark, Hui JoonAhn, Y. H.Park, Ji-YongLee, SoonilDr. Duc Cuong Nguyen","We investigated operation of a planar MAPbI3 solar cell with respect to intensity variation ranging from 0.01 to 1 sun. Measured J-V curves consisted of space-charge-limited currents (SCLC) in a drift-dominant range and diode-like currents in a diffusion-dominant range. The variation of power-law exponent of SCLC showed that charge trapping by defects diminished as intensity increased, and that drift currents became eventually almost ohmic. Diode-like currents were analysed using a modified Shockley-equation model, the validity of which was confirmed by comparing measured and estimated open-circuit voltages. Intensity dependence of ideality factor led us to the conclusion that there were two other types of defects that contributed mostly as recombination centers. At low intensities, monomolecular recombination occurred due to one of these defects in addition to bimolecular recombination to result in the ideality factor of ~1.7. However, at high intensities, another type of defect not only took over monomolecular recombination, but also dominated bimolecular recombination to result in the ideality factor of ~2.0. These ideality-factor values were consistent with those representing the intensity dependence of loss-current ratio estimated by using a constant internal-quantum-efficiency approximation. The presence of multiple types of defects was corroborated by findings from equivalent-circuit analysis of impedance spectra.",Article,"Engineering Physics

Instead of using RF bandwidth, VLC uses the visible light spectrum to perform lighting and communications functions simultaneously. In a large indoor environment, a multiple ceiling access point VLC network (multi-CAP VLC) is deployed to achieve seamless coverage and high spectral efficiency. In the multi-CAP VLC network, random movement of user equipment (UE) leads to an uneven load distribution between CAPs. Furthermore, the quality of service of cell-edge users who reside at cell edge areas is decreased due to the high attenuation of the received signal. In the paper, to improve the QoS of cell-edge UEs, we propose a coordinated multi-channel transmission scheme (CMcT) for indoor multi-CAP VLC networks. The CMcT performs a coordinated downlink data transmission from different CAPs to a UE simultaneously.

The proposed sensor includes of five electrodes symmetrically arranged surrounding an air–liquid two phases cylindrical tube, forming two pairs of electrodes for roll and pith angle measurement. Cylindrical plastic tube filled partly with dielectric fluid with dielectric constant of 2. The proposed sensor can detect tilt angles in x-axis and y-axis, i.e. roll and pith angles. When the cylindrical plastic tube is rotated, the dielectric fluid covers a portion of the induction electrodes, thereby changing the differential capacitance value of the capacitor corresponding to the tilt angle. By measuring the capacitance change, the tilt angle can be estimated. Performance of the sensor was investigated by Finite element method using Comsol Multiphysics simulation software. Simulation results show the variation in capacitance with respect to the variation of tilt angle. Based on this simulation model, the structure of the electrodes was manipulated for maximizing the sensitivity for roll and pith sensing in an appropriate working range. Experiments were also conducted for validation. The experiment results are well matched with simulated results. The optimized sensor has working range from −70° to +70° with sensitivity of 3 mV/° in the roll angle and from −30° to +30° with sensitivity of 17 mV/° in the pitch angle.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,,"Center for Electronics and Telecommunications Research (CETR)

A Variable Precision Approach for Deep Neural Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3721/,"Tran, Xuan TuyenNguyen, Duy AnhBui, Duy HieuTran, Xuan TuBùi Duy Hiếu","Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures have been recently considered as the big breakthrough for a variety of applications. Because of the high computing capabilities required, DNN has been unsuitable for various embedded applications. Many works have been trying to optimize the key operations, which are multiply-and-add, in hardware for a smaller area, higher throughput, and lower power consumption. One way to optimize these factors is to use the reduced bit accuracy; for examples, Google's TPU used only 8-bit integer operations for DNN inference. Based on the characteristics of different layers in DNN, further bit accuracy can be changed to preserve the hardware area, power consumption, and throughput. In this work, the thesis investigates a hardware implementation of multiply-and-add with variable bit precision which can be adjusted at the computation time. The proposed design can calculate the sum of several products with the bit precision ranging from 1 to 16 bits. The hardware implementation results on Xilinx FPGA Virtex 707 development kit show that our design occupies smaller hardware and can run at a higher frequency of 310 MHz, while the same functionality implemented with and without DSP48 blocks can only run at a frequency of 102 MHz. In addition, to demonstrate that the proposed design is applicable effectively for deep neural network architecture, the paper also integrated the new design in the MNIST network.

In case of ocean environment variability, there are many modeled field replicas thus the number of degree of freedom is increased, consequently the true source selection becomes more complexity. In this paper, we presents a MFP using an approach of Riemannian geometry in which Riemannian distance is obtained in close-form from a new isometric mapping and 20 modeled field replicas that are received in simulation from variable sound speeds.

Two material models are considered. The continuity requirement of material properties throughout layers are fulfilled by newly introducing refined effects of two porosity types regarding the average of constituent properties weighted by the porosity volume fraction. The first-order shear deformation theory taking the out-of-plane shear deformation into account is employed to obtain the Lagrange equation of motions. The number of primary variables reduces from five to three after introducing the Airy stress function. The system of dynamic governing equations is obtained by utilizing the Bubnov–Galerkin procedure. The natural frequencies are analytically computed by solving eigenvalue problems, and the fundamental frequencies are acquired by further assumptions about the inertial force caused by the shell rotation variables. The nonlinear dynamic responses of the functionally graded spherical, cylindrical, and hyperbolic paraboloid shells under the influence of different geometry configurations, loading conditions, and porosity types and degrees are obtained by applying the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The numerical results are presented and verified with available studies in the literature.

Meanwhile, full-duplex (FD) transmission can potentially double the spectral efficiency by allowing a node to receive and transmit simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the delivery time performance of full-duplex enabled MEC (FDMEC) systems, in which the users are served by distributed edge nodes (ENs), which operate in FD mode and are equipped with a limited storage memory. Firstly, we analyse the FD-MEC with different levels of cooperation among the ENs and take into account the realistic model of self-interference cancellation. Secondly, we propose a framework to minimize the system delivery time of FD-MEC under both linear and optimal precoding designs. Thirdly, to deal with the non-convexity of the formulated problems, two iterative optimization algorithms are proposed based on the inner approximation method, whose convergence is analytically guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed designs are demonstrated via extensive numerical results. It is shown that the cooperative scheme mitigates inter-user and self interference significantly better than the distributed scheme at the expense of inter-EN cooperation.

Learning to Transform Vietnamese Natural Language Queries into SQL Commands,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3663/,"Vuong, Thi Hai YenNguyen, Thi Thu TrangTran, Nhu ThuatNguyen, Le MinhPhan, Xuan HieuA/Prof. Xuan Hieu Phan","In the field of data management, users traditionally manipulates their data using structured query language (SQL). However, this method requires an understanding of relational database, data schema, and SQL syntax as well as the way it works. Database manipulation using natural language, therefore, is much more convenient since any normal user can interact with their data without a background of database and SQL. This is, however, really tough because transforming natural language commands into SQL queries is a challenging task in natural language processing and understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel two–phase approach to automatically analyzing and converting natural language queries into the corresponding SQL forms. In our approach, the first phase is component segmenta- tion which identifies primary clauses in SQL such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, etc. The second phase is slot– filling that helps extract sub–components for each primary clause such as SELECT column(s), SELECT aggregation operation, etc. We carefully conducted an empirical evaluation for our method using conditional random fields (CRFs) on a medium– sized corpus of natural language queries in Vietnamese, and have achieved promising results with an average accuracy of more than 90%.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2019

To date, many studies have focused on missing condition data, but very few have accounted for missing decision data, especially in enlarging datasets. One of the approaches for dealing with missing data in condition attributes is named twofold rough approximations. The paper aims to extend the approach to deal with missing data in the decision attribute. In addition, computing twofold rough approximations is very intensive, thus the approach is not suitable when input datasets are large. We propose parallel algorithms to compute twofold rough approximations in large-scale datasets. Our method is based on MapReduce, a distributed programming model for processing large-scale data. We introduce the original sequential algorithm first and then the parallel version is introduced. Comparison between the two approaches through experiments shows that our proposed parallel algorithms are suitable for and perform efficiently on large-scale datasets that have missing data in condition and decision attributes.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Rating the Effectiveness of Fishery Closures With Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Boat Detection Data,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3358/,"Christopher, D. ElvidgeTilottama, GhoshKimberly, BaughMikhail, ZhizhinFeng-Chi, HsuNilo, Selim KatadaWilmon, PenalosaBui, Quang HungBùi Quang Hưng","Fishery closures are widely used to promote the sustainability of fish stocks. Fishery agencies typically have very little data relevant to planning closure enforcement actions and evaluating the effectiveness of closures, due in part to the vast expanse and remote nature of many closures. In some cases the effectiveness of closures can be evaluated using data from GPS based beacons, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) or Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) installed on fishing boats. In fisheries where few boats are equipped with AIS or VMS, the rating of closures relies on other data sources capable of detecting or inferring fishing activity. One such source comes from low light imaging data collected by the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which can detect fishing boats using lights to attract catch. This is a widely used practice in Asia and several other regions. NOAA has developed an automatic system for reporting the locations of VIIRS boat detections with a nominal 4 h temporal latency. VIIRS boat detection alerts are running for more than 900 fishery closures in the Philippines, with email and SMS transmission modes. These alerts are being actively used in the Philippines to plan enforcement actions and there is a growing list of apprehensions that occurred based on tip-offs from VIIRS. The VIIRS boat detection archive extends back to April 2012. A VIIRS closure index (VCI) has been developed to rate the effectiveness of closures on monthly increments in terms of a percentage. The VCI analysis was performed on three types of closures: an ad hoc fishery closure associated with a toxic industrial discharge, a seasonal fishery closure and a permanent closure in restricted coastal waters. The VCI results indicate that it is possible to rank the effectiveness of different closure, year-to-year differences in compliance levels, and to identify closure encroachments which may warrant additional enforcement effort.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

H. LanMai, Xuan TruongDoan, Van ThuanBach, Long GiangNguyen, Duy ChinhNguyen, Duc CuongDr. Duc Cuong Nguyen","High purity Zirconium (Zr) materials are essential in many components of nuclear reactors, especially fuel cladding tubes. Due to the matrix influence, determination of impurities in the Zr materials requires separation from the Zr matrix. Among extraction methods, solvent extraction is common and suitable for large-scale production. In this study, extraction capability of Zr(IV) by 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono 2-ethylhexyl ester (PC88A) was examined by FT-IR and UV of ZrO(NO3)2 salt, PC88A-toluene solvent, and Zr-PC88A-toluene complex. ZrO2 (obtained from Institute for Technology of Radioactive and Rare Elements—ITRRE), after being separated from the Zr matrix, was determined for impurities using internal standard (indium, In) by 50% of PC88A dissolved in toluene. Separation of impurities from the Zr matrix underwent two stages. First, one cycle of extraction of the Zr matrix and impurities in 3 M HNO3 using 50% PC88A/toluene was conducted. Second, impurities were scrubbed by 4 M HNO3 in two cycles. Results revealed that approximately 74% of Zr(IV) was separated to the organic phase and 26% remained in the aqueous phase. Determination of impurities after separation from the Zr matrix by ICP-MS using internal standard in revealed that the recovery of impurities achieved 95–100%. With the mentioned amount of Zr, the effect of the Zr matrix on the determination of elements by ICP-MS is negligible. Levels of impurities have relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 6.9% and recovery of 88.6–98.8%. Therefore, the determination of impurities has high reliability and accuracy. The back-extraction of Zr(IV) in organic phase by 1 M H2SO4 has stripped about 99.5% of the Zr matrix back to the aqueous phase. Following this, NH3 was added to the solution containing Zr after back-extraction to form Zr(OH)4 which was then desiccated to produce ZrO2. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM) images showed that the new ZrO2 product has spherical nanostructure with diameters of less than 25 nm, which is suitable for applications for the treatment of colorants, metal ions in wastewater sources and manufacture of anti-corrosion steel. In addition, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) of the new ZrO2 product showed that it has high purity.",Article,"Scopus-indexed journals

Parity-based ECC and Mechanism for Detecting and Correcting Soft Errors in On-Chip Communication,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3051/,"Dang, Nam KhanhTran, Xuan TuProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","Soft errors are expecting to be accelerated with the shrinking of feature sizes due to low operating voltages and high circuit density. However, soft error rates per single-bit is expectedly reduced with technology scaling. With tight requirements for the area and energy consumption, using a low complexity and high coding rate error correction code (ECC) to handle soft errors in on-chip communication is necessary. In this work, we use Parity Product Code (PPC) and propose several supporting mechanisms to detect and correct soft errors. First, PPC can work as a parity check to detect single event upset (SEU) inside each flit. Then, to reduce the needed retransmission, a Razor flip-flop with parity check (RFF-w-P) is proposed to work with PPC. Since PPC can act like forward error correction (FEC), we also present a selective transmission in bit-indexes by using a transposable FIFO. Therefore, the proposed mechanism not only guarantee single error detection/correction but also provide 2+ error correction as FEC. The proposed work also reduce the area cost of FIFO in comparison to traditional coding methods and adapt too multiple error rates.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

However, the data associated with long hours surveillance video is huge, making it less attractive to practical applications. In this paper, we propose a low complexity, yet efficient scalable video coding solution for video surveillance system. The proposed surveillance video compression scheme is able to provide the quality scalability feature by following a layered coding structure that consists of one or several enhancement layers on the top of a base layer. In addition, to maintain the backward compatibility with the current video coding standards, the state-of-the-art video coding standard, i.e., High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), is employed in the proposed coding solution to compress the base layer. To satisfy the low complexity requirement of the encoder for the video surveillance systems, the distributed coding concept is employed at the enhancement layers. Experiments conducted for a rich set of surveillance video data shown that the proposed surveillance - distributed scalable video coding (S-DSVC) solution significantly outperforms relevant video coding benchmarks, notably the SHVC standard and the HEVC-simulcasting while requiring much lower computational complexity at the encoder which is essential for practical video surveillance applications.",Article,Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3087/1/VNU%20-%20JS_Xiem2018.pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2018

A new design of a jet flow gyroscope using ion wind corona discharge is developed by conducting a numerical simulation and then an experimental analysis with regard to the advantages of a corona-discharge-based jet flow. Ion wind is generated by applying a high-voltage between a pin, as the discharge electrode, and a ring, as the reference electrode. The current-voltage characteristics of the discharge process by experimental works is set up as the boundary condition to describe the ion wind flow in the numerical simulation. A jet flow of ion wind is observed through an experiment and a simulation. When the gyroscope is subjected to an angular rate, the induced Coriolis force deflects the ion wind. This deflection is detected using four hotwires installed downstream of the working chamber behind the reference electrode. The experimental result show that the angular rate can be detected with a sensitivity of 4.7 uV/o/s.

Unlike the conventional configuration where one electrode generates charged ions moving towards the reference electrode, this configuration allows both negative and positive charges to simultaneously move away from the device and generate ion wind in parallel with the electrodes. In comparison with the direct current (DC) driven corona generator, the time oscillating AC field allows the device a better stabilization owing to the independence of ion wind strength from the inter-electrode spacing. Our results by both simulation and experiment showed that when the AC frequency exceeds a threshold value of 1100 Hz, the electric field at the electrode tips is determined dominantly by the charge cloud created in the previous half-cycle, resulting in stronger net electric field and thus stronger ion wind. In addition, the electrode separation in the AC driven corona based generator is less critical above the frequency threshold, yielding a more robust design with minimized susceptibility to manufacturing tolerances and impurities on the electrodes. Moreover, lower voltage levels of the AC driven system allow simpler and more economical design in the high voltage circuit of the AC generator.",Article,"Parallel pin, Ion wind, Alternating current, Bipolar discharge",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894177718307970,ISI-indexed journals,2018

Based on the classical thin shell theory with the geometrical nonlinearity in von Karman Donnell sense, the smeared stiffeners technique and Galerkin method, this paper deals with vibration and nonlinear dynamic problem. The truncated conical shells are reinforced by ring stiffeners made of full metal or full ceramic depending on situation of stiffeners at the metal-rich or ceramic-rich side of the shell respectively. In addition, the study is not only assumed that the material properties depend on environment temperature variation, but also considered the thermal stresses in the stiffeners. Numerical results are given to evaluate effects of inhomogeneous, dimensional parameters, outside stiffeners, temperatures and elastic foundations to vibration and nonlinear dynamic response of structures.",Article,"Engineering Mechanics

All of these efforts lead to abate the demagnetization field. This paper describes from simulation toward experiment to find out the most effective method for enhancing magnetoelectric effect (ME) in current sensing applications. By using ring-shape magnetoelectric composites, many advantages were found includes: (i) enhance of the magnetic field concentration and (ii) eliminate impact of demagnetization field between magnetic layers thanks to closed magnetic circuit; (iii) easy to tune electromechanical resonances; and (iv) independent of the distance from the current-carrying cable. Indeed, it shows a variable resonant frequency from 20 to kHz 175 kHz depending on the size and structuce. An excellent linearly and an extremely high current sensitivity ~ 10 V/A was achieved in the Metglas/PZT/Metglas penta-layered laminates.

In order to further improve the effectiveness of plasma in cancer therapy, it is important to understand the generation and transport of plasma reactive species into tissue fluids, tissues and cells, and moreover the rates and depths of delivery, particularly across physical barriers such as skin. In this study, helium (He) plasma jet treatmentof a 3D cancer tumour, grown on the back of a live mouse, induced apoptosis within the tumour to a depth of 2.8 mm. The He plasma jet was shown to deliver reactive oxygen species through the unbroken skin barrier before penetrating through the entire depth of the tumour. The depth and rate of transport of He plasma jet generated H2O2, NO3− and NO2−, as well as aqueous oxygen [O2(aq)], was then tracked in an agarose tissue model. This provided an approximation of the H2O2, NO3−, NO2− and O2(aq) concentrations that might have been generated during the He plasma jet treatment of the 3D tumour. It is proposed that the He plasma jet can induce apoptosis within a tumour by the ‘deep’ delivery of H2O2, NO3− and NO2− coupled with O2(aq); the latter raising oxygen tension in hypoxic tissue.

In this novel approach, they are deployed alongside trucks to deliver goods to customers to improve the quality of service and reduce the transportation cost. This approach gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called TSP with drone (TSP-D). A variant of this problem that aims to minimize the time at which truck and drone finish the service (or, in other words, to maximize the quality of service) was studied in the work of Murray and Chu (2015). In contrast, this paper considers a new variant of TSP-D in which the objective is to minimize operational costs including total transportation cost and one created by waste time a vehicle has to wait for the other. The problem is first formulated mathematically. Then, two algorithms are proposed for the solution. The first algorithm (TSP-LS) was adapted from the approach proposed by Murray and Chu (2015), in which an optimal TSP solution is converted to a feasible TSP-D solution by local searches. The second algorithm, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is based on a new split procedure that optimally splits any TSP tour into a TSP-D solution. After a TSP-D solution has been generated, it is then improved through local search operators. Numerical results obtained on various instances of both objective functions with different sizes and characteristics are presented. The results show that GRASP outperforms TSP-LS in terms of solution quality under an acceptable running time.",Article,"Scopus-indexed journals

Fuzzy DLs can be used for such domains when data and knowledge about them are vague. One of the possible ways to specify classes of objects in such domains is to use concepts in fuzzy DLs. As DLs are variants of modal logics, indiscernibility in DLs is characterized by bisimilarity. The bisimilarity relation of an interpretation is the largest auto-bisimulation of that interpretation. In (fuzzy) DLs, it can be used for concept learning. In this paper, for the first time, we define fuzzy bisimulation and (crisp) bisimilarity for fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics. The considered logics are fuzzy extensions of the DL ALCreg with additional features among inverse roles, nominals, qualified number restrictions, the universal role and local reflexivity of a role. We give results on invariance of concepts as well as conditional invariance of TBoxes and ABoxes for bisimilarity in fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics.

When tested on a domain-mismatch condition, the SUD model with sub-word based embedding trained from the in-domain data gives an approximate 2% and 1% improvement over the best model using out-of-domain embedding with reference and ASR transcription with 29.5% Word Error Rate respectively.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3170/1/paper92.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2018

In this paper, we detect the cow’s activities by using a multidimensional acceleration sensor and multiclass support vector machine (SVM). The acceleration sensor is attached to the cow’s neck-collar in order to sense the movements in X, Y, and Z axes. The data is brought to a microprocessor for pre-processing, and join in a wireless sensor network (WSN) through a Zigbee module. After that, the data are transferred to the server. At the server, a suitable SVM algorithm is chosen and applied to classify four main behaviors: standing, lying, feeding and walking. A well know kernels, Radius Basic Function (RBF), is chosen.

Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data.

However, bootstrapping is computationally expensive and remains a bottleneck in phylogenetic analyses. Recently, an ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) approach was proposed for maximum likelihood analyses. However, such an approach is still missing for maximum parsimony. RESULTS: To close this gap we present MPBoot, an adaptation and extension of UFBoot to compute branch supports under the maximum parsimony principle. MPBoot works for both uniform and non-uniform cost matrices. Our analyses on biological DNA and protein showed that under uniform cost matrices, MPBoot runs on average 4.7 (DNA) to 7 times (protein data) (range: 1.2-20.7) faster than the standard parsimony bootstrap implemented in PAUP*; but 1.6 (DNA) to 4.1 times (protein data) slower than the standard bootstrap with a fast search routine in TNT (fast-TNT). However, for non-uniform cost matrices MPBoot is 5 (DNA) to 13 times (protein data) (range:0.3-63.9) faster than fast-TNT. We note that MPBoot achieves better scores more frequently than PAUP* and fast-TNT. However, this effect is less pronounced if an intensive but slower search in TNT is invoked. Moreover, experiments on large-scale simulated data show that while both PAUP* and TNT bootstrap estimates are too conservative, MPBoot bootstrap estimates appear more unbiased.

In the proposed improvement solution, the temporal correlation between frames is exploited through a motion compensated temporal interpolation (MCTI) mechanism. The MCTI frame is then adaptively combined with the base layer reconstruction using a linear combination algorithm. In this combination, a weighting factor is defined and computed for each predicted block using the estimated errors associated to each input. Finally, to achieve the highest compression efficiency, the fused frame is treated as an additional reference and adaptively selected using a rate distortion optimization (RDO) mechanism.

Joint Layer Prediction for Improving SHVC Compression Performance and Error Concealment,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3088/,"Hoang, Van XiemByeungwoo, JeonDr. Xiem HoangVan","Scalable High Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) standard is expected to play a more important role in the heterogeneous landscape of broadcasting, multimedia, networks, and various services applications as it is specified as a layered coding technique in the ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) 3.0. However, its block-based structure of temporal and spatial prediction makes it sensitive to information loss and error propagation due to transmission errors. In this context, we propose an improved SHVC with a joint layer prediction (JLP) solution which adaptively combines the decoded information from the base and the enhancement layers to create an additional reference for the SHVC enhancement encoder. To optimize the quality of the joint prediction, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation is executed in computing a combination factor which gives weights to each contribution of the decoded information from the layers. In addition, the proposed JLP is integrated into the SHVC decoder to work as an error concealment solution to mitigate the error propagation happening inevitably in practical video transmission. Experiments have shown that the proposed SHVC framework significantly outperforms its relevant benchmarks, notably by up to 14.8% in bitrate reduction with respect to the standard SHVC codec.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of hierarchical caching systems, in which both BS and end users are equipped with a storage memory. In particular, we propose a novel cooperative caching scheme that jointly optimizes the content placement at the BS’s and users’ caches.

At the core of the cache server operation is the replacement algorithm, which is responsible for selecting, according to a cache replacement policy, the cached pages that should be removed in order to make space for new pages. Traditional replacement policies used in practice take advantage of temporal reference locality by removing the least recently/frequently requested pages from the cache. Lately, due to the properties of semantic content in of web page, there are some new attempts to implement cache replacement based on multiple parameters including semantic content.

Trong các thách thức kỹ thuật của VLC, cân bằng tải là một trong những vấn đề quan trọng cần được giải quyết trong mạng truyền thông ánh sáng nhìn thấy. Trong bài báo này, chúng tôi áp dụng cơ chế lựa chọn điểm truyền động (Dynamic Point Selection - DPS) của truyền dẫn đa điểm phối hợp (Coordinated Multipoint Transmission - CoMP)vào mạng truyền thông ánh sáng nhìn thấy. Đây là cơ chế có thể giải quyết vấn đề cân bằng tải hiệu quả bằng cách thực hiện việc lựa chọn điểm truyền dựa vào chất lượng kênh truyền và lượng tải của các điểm truy cập (Access Point – AP). Khi người dùng nằm trong vùng chồng lấn giữa các AP có lượng tải chênh lệch nhau, nếu người dùng đang được phục vụ bởi AP có tải cao, chất lượng kênh truyền kém thì việc sử dụng cơ chế CoMP – DPS giúp cho người dùng được kết nối với AP có tải thấp hơn và chất lượng kênh truyền tốt hơn. Trong bài báo này, chúng tôi so sánh hiệu quả của cơ chế CoMP – DPS đề xuất so với truyền dẫn thông thường và chứng minh rằng cơ chế này giúp lượng tải của hệ thống được cân bằng, tăng thông lượng, giảm độ trễ gói tin trung bình của người dùng nằm ở vùng chồng lấn của các AP.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications > Communications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3254/1/REV-ECIT-Khuong%20Thi%20Oanh%20-%20paper%206.pdf,"Advanced Insitute of Engineering and Technology (AVITECH)

In this study, we assess the current status of air pollution over Hanoi, Vietnam using multiple different satellite datasets and weather information, and assess the potential to capture rice residue burning emissions with satellite data in a cloud-covered region. We used a timeseries of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI) satellite data to characterize absorbing aerosols related to biomass burning. We also tested a timeseries of 3-hourly MERRA-2 reanalysis Black Carbon (BC) concentration data for 5 years from 2012–2016 and explored pollution trends over time. We then used MODIS active fires, and synoptic wind patterns to attribute variability in Hanoi pollution to different sources. Because Hanoi is within the Red River Delta where rice residue burning is prominent, we explored trends to see if the residue burning signal is evident in the UVAI or BC data. Further, as the region experiences monsoon-influenced rainfall patterns, we adjusted the BC data based on daily rainfall amounts. Results indicated forest biomass burning from Northwest Vietnam and Laos impacts Hanoi air quality during the peak UVAI months of March and April. Whereas, during local rice residue burning months of June and October, no increase in UVAI is observed, with slight BC increase in October only. During the peak BC months of December and January, wind patterns indicated pollutant transport from southern China megacity areas. Results also indicated severe pollution episodes during December 2013 and January 2014. We observed significantly higher BC concentrations during nighttime than daytime with peaks generally between 2130 and 0030 local time. Our results highlight the need for better air pollution monitoring systems to capture episodic pollution events and their surface-level impacts, such as rice residue burning in cloud-prone regions in general and Hanoi, Vietnam in particular.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Integrating Word Embeddings into IBM Word Alignment Models,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3266/,"Le, Anh CuongNguyen, Tuan PhongTran, Quoc LongDao, Bao LinhLong Trần Quốc","Wordalignmentmodelsareusedtogenerate word-aligned parallel text which is used in statistical machine translation systems. Currently, the most popular word alignment models are IBM models which have been widely applied in a large number of translation systems. The parameters of IBM models are estimated by using Maximum Likelihood principle, i.e. by counting the cooccurrence of words in the parallel text. This way of parameter estimation leads to the “ambiguity” problem when some words stand together in many sentence pairs but each of them is not translation of any other. Additionally, this method requires large amount of training data to achieve good results. However, parallel text which is used to train the IBM models is usually limited for low-resource languages. In this work, we try to solve these two problems by adding semantic information to the models. Our semantic information is derived from word embeddings which only need monolingual data to train. We deploy evaluation on a language pair that has great differences in grammar structure, English-Vietnamese.

This task is known as next-item recommendation. We hypothesize two means for improvement. First, within each time step, a user may interact with multiple items (a basket), with potential latent associations among them. Second, predicting the next item in the target sequence may be helped by also learning from another supporting sequence (e.g., clicks). We develop three twin network structures modeling the generation of both target and support basket sequences.

Formalization and Verification of AUTOSAR OS Standard's Memory Protection,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2965/,"Le, Khanh TrinhLê Khánh Trình","AUTOSAR OS is a standard for automotive operating systems, which provides a specification that consists ofu nctionalities such as scheduling services, timing services, and memory protection. In this paper, we focus on memory protection features among them. As the AUTOSAR OS specification is described in natural language, its ambiguity may confuse developers as well as cause the contradiction of the specification, then eventually lead to serious problems of automotive systems such as bugs and errors. These problems in automotive systems relate directly to the safety of human being. Thus, it is very important to ensure the unambiguity and consistency of the specification. Our solution for the problems is formalizing the AUTOSAR OS specification using Event-B specification language which allows us to formally specify the functionalities of AUTOSAR OS and reduce the ambiguity of natural language. We developed a formal specification of the memory protection of AUTOSAR OS and verified its consistency. In this verification, we found the inconsistency of the specification during discharging proof obligations generated by RODIN which is a tool for Event-B. This inconsistency comes from the ambiguity of the original specification, and finding it by reviewing based on natural language description is very hard. In this paper, we explain how we found the inconsistency existed in the AUTOSAR OS standard after showing our approach to formalize and verify it with Event-B.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2965/1/trinhlk-formalization-verification-autosar-edit%202.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2018

Recent work in DDD use an annotation-based extension of object-oriented programming language to build the domain model. This model becomes the basis for a ubiquitous language and is used as input to generate software. However, the annotation-based extensions of these work do not adequately address the primitive and essential structural and behavioural modelling requirements of practical software. Further, they do not precisely characterise the software that is generated from the domain model. In this paper, we propose a DSL-based DDD method to address these limitations. We make four contributions: (1) An annotation-based domain-specific language (DSL) named DCSL, whose annotation extension expresses a set of essential structural constraints and the essential behaviour of a domain class. (2) A structural mapping between the state and behaviour spaces of a domain class. This mapping enables a technique for generating the behavioural specification.

Our proposed system is designed to be lightweight in computation and very fast in response to the changes of travelers’ vehicle modes or driving events. The vehicle mode detection module is responsible for recognizing both motorized vehicles, such as cars, buses, and motorbikes, and non-motorized ones, for instance, walking, and bikes. It relies only on accelerometer data in order to minimize the energy consumption of smartphones. By contrast, the driving activity detection module uses the data collected from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer of a smartphone to detect various driving activities, i.e., stopping, going straight, turning left, and turning right. Furthermore, we propose a method to compute the optimized data window size and the optimized overlapping ratio for each vehicle mode and each driving event from the training datasets. The experimental results show that this strategy significantly increases the overall prediction accuracy. Additionally, numerous experiments are carried out to compare the impact of different feature sets (time domain features, frequency domain features, Hjorth features) as well as the impact of various classification algorithms (Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Decision tree J48, K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine) contributing to the prediction accuracy.

By using a force excitation, the shear wave speed is acquired to extract its amplitude and phase. This information is then used directly or indirectly to compute the Complex Shear Modulus (CSM consists of elasticity and viscosity). Among these methods, Algebraic Helmholtz Inversion (AHI) algorithm can be combined with the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) model to estimate CSM effectively. However, this algorithm is strongly affected by measured noise while acquiring the particle velocity. Thus, we proposed a LMS/AHI algorithm which can estimate correctly CSM. A simulation scenario is built to confirm the performance of the proposed LMS/AHI algorithm with average error of 3:14%.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

Quantification of non-rigid liver deformation in radiofrequency ablation interventions using image registration,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3046/,"Luu Manh, HaMoelker, AdriaanKlein, StefanNiessen, WiroWalsum, Theo vanLưu Mạnh Hà","Multi-modal image fusion for image guidance in minimally invasive liver interventions generally requires a registration of pre-operatively acquired images to interventional images of the patient. Whereas rigid registration approaches are fast and can be used in an interventional setting, the actual liver deformation may be non-rigid. The purpose of this paper is to assess the magnitude of non-rigid deformation of the liver between pre-operative and interventional CT images in case of tumor ablations, over the full liver and over parts of the liver that match the volumes typically imaged by a 3D ultrasound transducer. We acquired 3D abdominal CT scans of 38 patients that underwent radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors, pre-operative CT images as well as intra-operative CT images. To determine the magnitude of liver deformation due to pose changes and respiration, we non-rigidly registered the pre-operative CT scan to the intra-operative CT scan. By fitting this deformation to a rigid transformation in a region of interest and computing the residual displacements, the non-rigid deformation part can be quantified. We performed quantifications over the complete liver, as well as for two volumes of interest representative for sub-xiphoidal and inter-costal 3D ultrasound acquisitions. The results showed that a substantial amount of non-rigid deformation was found, and rotation of patient's pose and deep inhalation caused significant liver deformation. Hence we concluded that non-rigid motion correction in the interventions should be taken into account.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

Compared to standard finite element method, the recently developed consecutive-interpolation has been shown to possess many desirable features, such as higher accuracy and smooth nodal gradients it still satisfies the Kronecker-delta property and keeps the total number of degrees of freedom unchanged. The discontinuity in displacement fields along the crack faces and stress singularity around the crack tips are mathematically modeled using enrichment functions. The Heaviside function is employed to describe displacement jump, while four branch functions being developed from asymptotic stress fields are taken as basis functions to capture singularities. The interesting characteristic of functionally graded composites is the spatial variation of material properties which are intentionally designed to be served for particular purposes. Such variation has to be taken into account during the computation of Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs).

The laminated nanocomposite plates are made of various amorphous polymer matrices: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly{(m-phenylenevinylene)-co-[(2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylene) vinylene]} (PmPV). The nonlinear equations are solved by both Galerkin method and Runge-Kutta method based on Reddy’s third-order laminated plate theory.

Congestion Control Algorithm for Message Routing in Structured Peer-to-Peer Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3091/,"Nguyen, Dinh NghiaNguyen, Hoai SonHoai Son Nguyen","In structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, every node must perform message routing to deliver query messages to destination nodes. Therefore, they often have to process a large number of query messages quickly and efficiently. When the number of query messages sending to a node exceeds its routing capacity, a local congestion on the node occurs and reduces the information pro- cessing of the other nodes in the network. This paper proposes a congestion control algorithm for message routing in structured P2P networks by changing the routing table of nodes in the network to route the packet to the destination without going through congested nodes. The performance of the proposed the method has been evaluated and compared with the conventional Chord protocol. The result shows that our proposed method improves the query success rate significantly while minimizing the number of packets generated during congestion control process.",Article,Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3091/1/30.JCSC2018.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2018

A New Approach to Estimate Urban Air Temperature Using Smartphones,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3217/,"Nguyen, Hai ChauHải Châu Nguyễn","Measuring urban air temperature at a high spatial resolution is very important for many applications including detection of urban heat islands. However air temperature is currently measured by professional weather stations those are very sparse at 50 km spatial resolution or more. In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate air temperature from smartphones. Most of the smartphones are not equipped with air temperature sensors. However they are all equipped with battery temperature sensors. When a smartphone is in idle state, its battery temperature is stable and correlated with air temperature around the smartphone. Therefore we have developed a linear regression model to estimate air temperature from the idle smartphones battery temperature. Experiment results show that the new approach is statistically comparable to an existing one using mean error, mean absolute error and coefficient of determination metrics. Advantages of the new approach include simplicity of implementation on smartphones and ability of creating maps of temperature distribution.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2018

Second, by using data pre-processing and robust statistics estimate, we introduce a second method that is shown to be the most efficient for subspace tracking in the case of impulsive noise (e.g. α-stable noise). Finally, a ‘detect-and-skip’ approach is adopted where the corrupted measurements are detected and treated as ‘missing’ data. The resulting algorithm is particularly effective in the case where the data is affected by sparse ‘outliers’. All these approaches were analyzed and their convergence properties were investigated.

When creating user posts, readers tend to borrow salient words or phrases in sentences. This can be considered as word variation. This paper proposes a framework which models the word variation aspect to enhance the quality of Web document summarization. Technically, the framework consists of two steps: scoring and selection. In the first step, the social information of a Web document such as user posts is exploited to model intra-relations and inter-relations in lexical and semantic levels. These relations are denoted by a mutual reinforcement similarity graph used to score each sentence and user post. After scoring, summaries are extracted by using a ranking approach or concept-based method formulated in the form of Integer Linear Programming. To confirm the efficiency of our framework, sentence and story highlight extraction tasks were taken as a case study on three datasets in two languages, English and Vietnamese. Experimental results show that: (i) the framework can improve ROUGE-scores compared to state-of-the-art baselines of social context summarization and (ii) the combination of the two relations benefits the sentence extraction of single Web documents.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Since LNO is a low-cost material and a simple fabrication process, it has been attracted much attention for commercialization. In this paper, we have focused on optimizing the fabrication process of LNO thin films on SiO2/Si substrate and Al foil by using a solution process. The crystal structure and surface morphology were characterized by using X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), respectively. It was found that the LNO thin films annealed in range of 550-700oC for 30 minutes exhibited a well-formed crystallization and a dense microstructure. According to the SEM cross-sectional observation, the thickness of LNO thin films was estimated about 80 nm. Also, from the four-probe measurement method, the electrical resistivity of LNO thin film annealed at 600oC had a minimum value of 0.42 × 10-2 Ωcm, which was possibly comparable to conventional conductive oxides. As a result, the capacitor using Pb1.2(Zr0.4Ti0.6)O3 ferroelectric layer annealed at 600oC and LNO bottom electrode provided an interesting ferroelectricity, which included a remnant polarization of 21 µC/cm2 and a saturated polarization of 35 µC/cm2.

The repetition of sequential adsorption/drying of the mixture solution (luciferase and D-luciferin) was performed using paper disc. The storage stability of the paper discs at room temperature was maintained for one month following their preparation while the storage stability of the liquid-based ATP assay not maintained even for one day.

Artificial Intelligence Based Adaptive GOP Size Selection for Effective Wyner-Ziv Video Coding,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3086/,"Nguyen, Thi Huong ThaoPhi, Cong HuyVu, Huu TienHoang, Van XiemDr. Xiem HoangVan","Wyner-Ziv video coding (WZVC) has been gaining many attentions in recent decades due to its low computational complexity and error resiliency benefits, notably when compared to traditional video coding standards such as H.264/AVC or High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standards. In a WynerZiv video coding scheme, the compression efficiency can be controlled by the length of the group of pictures (GOP) which typically consists of the two key and several WZ frames. However,the current Wyner-Ziv video coding solutions usually employ a fixed GOP size or simple adaptive GOP size mechanisms, which depend on some heuristic features extracted from video content. To address the limitation of the current GOP size adaptation solutions, we propose in this paper a novel Artificial Intelligence based GOP size adaptation mechanism and integrate it into the most advanced transform domain Wyner-Ziv video coding (TDWZ) architecture. In the proposed GOP size adaptation mechanism, the proper GOP size is learnt from the correlation between video features and the optimal compression performance. The power of machine learning techniques is used to select the most suitable video features and the model of GOP size and compression performance correlation. Experimental results shown that, using the obtained GOP size adaptation mechanism, the TDWZ achieved a compression performance when compared to relevant benchmarks.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3086/1/1570472020%20%281%29.pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2018

The ZnO electron acceptor layer attracts less attention whereas it shows the key roles in extracting and transporting charge carriers in heterojunction. The utilization of 1-D ZnO structures has been demonstrated to be large interface areas and good carrier pathways for efficient carrier collection. However, the influences of the morphology of metal oxide nanostructures on the photovoltaic performance of QD-based solar cells have been few in-depth reports. Objective: In this work, ZnO NRs/PbS QD based solar cells were fabricated. The influences of the ZnO NRs array structures on characteristics of ZnO NRs/PbS QD based solar cells were investigated. Method: ZnO NRs/PbS QD based solar cells were fabricated via spin coating method. XRD, SEM, UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, I-V and EQE measurement systems were utilized to investigate the fabricated samples. Results: We have found optimum combinations of the linked parameters of ZnO NRs, their length of (230 ± 5) nm and density of (1.50 ± 5)x1010 # of rods.cm-2, that exhibit maximum efficiency of ∼2.5% for the ZnO NR/PbS QDs based solar cell. Conclusion: The influences the ZnO NRs structures on the solar cell characteristics, including the absorption, external quantum efficiency, and current density-voltage curves, were investigated. There seems to be an optimum between NR length and their density for resulting in maximum efficiency. This could be due the interplay of solar flux absorption and junction area controlled by these two parameters of ZnO NR morphology.",Article,"Engineering Physics

During each lesson, students often do not have time to ask the instructor about the relevant issues of the subject that they want to answer. In addition, students often hesitate to talk directly with teachers about issues related to the content of the subject. The Question Answering (Q&A) system, therefore, is a useful tool to assist students and teachers to engage in interactive activities, especially in online courses. This research focuses on reviewing the state of the art of two respects as methods and techniques for developing question and answer systems, including issues of question classification, retrieval of information and extraction of answers as core components of the Q&A system. In addition, the paper proposes a model of an online questionnaire system for blended interactive learning activities which are being tested at a university training institution.

A Spatial-temporal 3D Human Pose Reconstruction Framework,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3213/,"Nguyen, Xuan ThanhNgo, Thi DuyenLe, Thanh HaNgÃ´ Thá»� DuyÃªn","3D human pose reconstruction from single-view camera is a difficult and challenging topic. Many approaches have been proposed, but almost focus on frame-by-frame independently while inter-frames are highly correlated in a pose sequence. In contrast, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal 3D reconstruction framework that leverages both intra and inter frame relationships in consecutive 2D pose sequences. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, pre-trained Pose-angle Limits and Temporal Models have been implemented. We quantitatively compare our framework with recent works on CMU motion capture dataset and Vietnamese traditional dance sequences. Our method outperforms others with 10 percent lower of Euclidean reconstruction error and robustness against Gaussian noise. Additionally, it is also important to mention that our reconstructed 3D pose sequences are smoother and more natural than others",Article,Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2018
Statistical Machine Translation For Vietnamese Grammatical Error Correction,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3350/,"Nguyen Binh, NguyenNguyen Van, VinhNguyá»�n V","Nowadays, along with the development of Natural Language Processing, there are a lot of research which use Statistical Machine Translation for grammatical error correction. Despite the fact that, there are a few researches which can be applied to Vietnamese. As a result, our purpose is to implement grammatical error correction in Vietnamese. The problem can easily describe like this: you have a wrong sentence as input, after being processed by the model, you will have the right sentence as output. In this research, we focus on applying Statistical Machine Translation to Vietnamese. This is a part of Machine Learning approach in order to solve the grammatical error correction problem. At first, we will try to create a list of all kind of Vietnamese’s error. Then, we aim for correcting simple error, like spelling error, then we develop the system step by step to handle and correct complex error. To do that, the model need lots of data to train, so we collect as much Vietnamese sentences as possible, and turn them into wrong to make parallel data. The data will be divided into three parts, which are used for training, tuning, and testing, respectively. After all, the model achieved some results, where the sentences with spelling mistake is corrected better than others. The result is not too good, but it can be seen that we can apply Statistical Machine Translation for the Grammatical error correction problem.",Technical Report (Technical Report),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3350/1/SMT_Grammatical%20error%20correction_Report_Nguyen_Tuan_Vinh-2018%20%281%29.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2018

The idea of the system is to build an information transceiver system for maritime vehicles similar to the Automatic Identification System but more active. The trans- mitter is automatically able to switch the suitable power level and the operating frequency from VHF/UHF band when at short distance to the shore to S band when at long distance to the shore to communicate with satellites. The receiver uses a low noise amplifier that based on a balanced configuration with some advantages. The calculated ship-to-satellite link budget when using S-band shows that the received power at satellite better than the one of the conventional system.

A Status Data Transmitting System for Vessel Monitorin,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2910/,"Nguyen Dinh, The AnhLe Xuan, HuyVu Tuan, AnhBach Gia, DuongBạch Gia Dương","Abstract: This paper presents a status data transmitting system suitable for vessel monitoring. The system consists of four main parts, which are a frequency synthesizer, a horn antenna, a status data module and a power amplifier. The proposed frequency synthesizer can flexibly change the frequency in a wide range (from 600 MHz to 4.2 GHz) and the output power (from -6 dBm to -3 dBm). By using the phase-locked loop, the synthesizer’s stability over temperature and tolerance are comparable to temperature compensated crystal oscillators (TCXO) that is about +/- 3 ppm. Moreover, phase noise performance of the synthesizer is less than -90 dBc/Hz at 1 KHz and -100 dBc/Hz at 100 KHz. The impedance bandwidth of the horn antenna can be controlled by using the beveling technique. The status data module packs information of the identification, longitude, latitude, and state of the vessel into data frames. FSK/MSK/GMSK schemes were used to modulate the data. The power amplifier provides 130 W output power at S-band. The fundamental characteristics of the implemented transmitter have been measured and verified.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

The material properties of functionally graded shells are assumed to vary through the thickness direction by a power rule distribution of volume fractions of the constituents. The numerical examples demonstrated that the present ES-MITC3 method is free of shear locking and achieves the high accuracy compared to the exact solutions and others existing elements in the literature.",Conference or Workshop Item (Speech),Engineering Mechanics,,Faculty of Engineering Mechanics and Automation (FEMA),2018

By co-designing a switching power amplifier, high performance inductive coils and rectifier with load, the inductive power transfer system is proposed. Practical issues such as coil winding to maximize power transfer efficiency, effective implementation of ferrite, and the optimal design of impedance transformation network are considered. Power measurement results demonstrate that the harvester system achieves a measured power efficiency of ~3.4 %.

Recently, increasing attention has been paid to exploration of relatively less understood minor loop behavior, since faster operation of magnetic devices is inevitably accompanied by minor hysteresis behavior from cycling among unsaturated ferromagnetic states. Here, we report our microscopic investigation of unusual minor hysteresis loop behavior, represented by rounded or sharpened response of minor hysteresis loop of (CoFeB/Pd)4 multilayer flm. It is observed that rounded and sharpened response in the minor hysteresis response could be manifested under proper conditions. The minor loop behavior has been systematically investigated by direct microscopic magnetic domain observation using magneto-optical Kerr microscopy. The rounded response of magnetization at the reversing external feld along the minor hysteresis curve, so far neglected or considered as one of ‘unusual’ behaviors, has been found to be elaborately controllable by tuning the reversing feld strength and the feld sweep rate for multilayers with low repeat numbers. Variable roundedness of the minor hysteresis loop is understandable based on the analysis of magnetic domain dynamics such as domain nucleation and the domain wall velocity.",Article,"Engineering Physics

Therefore, the smaller language assumptions, the more computational cost we can reduce in software verification. Moreover, strong assumptions are more important in CBS verification in the context of software evolution because they can be reused many times in the verification process. For this reason, this paper presents a method for generating locally strongest assumptions with locally smallest languages during CBS verification. The key idea of this method is to create a variant technique for answering membership queries of the Teacher when responding to the Learner in the L–based assumption learning process. This variant technique is then integrated into an algorithm in order to generate locally strongest assumptions. These assumptions will effectively reduce the computational cost when verifying CBS, especially for large–scale and evolving ones.

Gold-coated electrodes are inserted into both ends of the tube to make good contact with the liquid. When the silicone tube is affected by an external force, its geometry and electrical characteristics of the mixture inside the tube are changed, resulting in the change in the sensor resistance. The proposed sensor was fabricated and experimentally characterized. The 4-point resistance measurement based on alternating Howland current source was applied to the sensor for measuring the change in resistance of the sensor. A circuit board with PIC16F877A microcontroller is also developed for data acquisition and result display.

In Phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) systems, syntactic pre-ordering is a commonly used preprocessing technique. This technique can be used to adjust the syntax of the source language to that of the target language by changing the word order of a source sentence prior to translation and solving to overcome a weakness of classical phrase-based translation systems: long distance reordering.

However, most temporal methods are based on the motion vector fields (MVFs) calculated by the optical flow or block-based motion estimation which has very high computational complexity. To alleviate this issue, the authors propose a temporal-disparity-based view synthesis (TDVS) method, which uses the MVFs extracted from the bitstreams of side views and motion warping technique to create the temporal correlation between views in the intermediate position. Then a motion compensation technique is used to create a temporal-based view. Finally, the temporal-based view is fused with a disparity-based view which is generated by a traditional depth image-based rendering technique to create the final synthesised view. The fusion of these views is performed based on the side information which is determined and encoded at the sender-side of the 3D video system using a dynamic programming algorithm and rate-distortion optimisation scheme. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve the synthesised view with appreciable improvements in comparison with the view synthesis reference software 1D fast (VSRS-1D Fast) for several test sequences.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

The security can be enhanced by using standardized and proven-secure block ciphers as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption and authentication.

Our design supports multiple security levels through different key sizes, power and energy optimization for both datapath and key expansion.

It is based on tracking the shrinking droplet radius and observing stagnant liquid molecules during and after the liquid evaporation process. The device configuration is suitable to test small amounts of liquids, in the microliter range. According to both mass loading and physical property mechanisms, eight samples of liquids, isopropanol (IPA), ethanol (ETH), deionized-water (DW), tap water (TW), heptane (HEP), propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and acetone (ACE), which have different equilibrium vapor pressures, molecular weights and boiling points, are accurately detected. The experimental results show that the rate of the change in the energy loss including a slow and fast attenuation region depends on the change of physical properties, such as density, sound speed in liquids and evaporation rate, during the evaporation process. As the evaporation rate of the DW is rather slow, the slow attenuation region occurs for a longer time than the fast one. Consequently, the whole oscillation duration of the attenuation occurs for a longer time, whereas that of the other liquids studied, like ACE, ETH, and IPA, having a faster evaporation rate is shorter. Sensitivities of the surface-acoustic-mode transducer to the evaporation process of liquids such as DW, TW, PGMEA, HMDS, HEP, IPA, ETH and ACE are -29.39, -29.53, -31.79, -34.12, -33.62, -32.87, -32.67, and -32.82 dB small mu m-2{,} respectively.

It is studied through the dynamic change of the droplet shape during the evaporation process. An aluminium nitride SAW device, operating at 125.7 MHz, is utilized to investigate the deformation of the droplet shape (contact angle and contact radius) caused by shrinking. The large cavity placed on the propagation path distorts the in-band SAW response one time at the centre frequency. The fractional coefficient of the SAW insertion loss, before and after dropping the liquid on the propagation path, is continuously recorded. The change in the fractional coefficient shows that the radiated acoustic kinetic energy depends on the contact area between the sessile micro-size droplet and the SAW device more than the contact angle of the droplet. Three droplet volumes have been considered, namely 0.05, 0.1 and 0.13 μl, and the electrical results show a better agreement with the theoretical data than the optical image data. The average duration of the fractional coefficient change for these cases is 420, 573 and 760 s, respectively. The effect of the hydrophobicity versus hydrophilicity of the contact surface on the duration of the fractional coefficient change is studied by coating the SAW with a silicon oxide or hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) thin layer.

This problem captures some essential challenges faced by a logistics provider which operates transportation services for a limited number of partners and should respect contractual obligations on service levels. The problem also generalizes several important classes of vehicle routing problems with profits. To solve it, we propose a compact mathematical formulation, a branch-and-price algorithm, and a hybrid genetic algorithm with population management, which relies on problem-tailored solution representation, crossover and local search operators, as well as an adaptive penalization mechanism establishing a good balance between service levels and costs. Our computational experiments show that the proposed heuristic returns very high-quality solutions for this difficult problem, matches all optimal solutions found for small and medium-scale benchmark instances, and improves upon existing algorithms for two important special cases: the vehicle routing problem with private fleet and common carrier, and the capacitated profitable tour problem.

On the other hand, the reliability of 3D-NoCs, due to the vulnerability of Through Silicon Vias, still remains as a major problem. Most of the existing techniques rely on correcting the TSV defects by using redundancies or employing routing algorithms. Nevertheless, they are not suitable for TSV-cluster defects as they can either lead to costly area and power consumption overheads or they may result in non-minimal routing paths; thus, posing serious threats to the system reliability and overall performance. In this work, we present a scalable and low-overhead TSV usage and design method for 3D-NoC systems where the TSVs of a router can be utilized by its neighbors to deal with the cluster open defects. An adaptive online algorithm is also introduced to assist the proposed system to immediately work around the newly detected defects without using redundancies. The experimental results show the proposal ensure less than 2% of the routers being disabled, even with 50% of the TSV clusters defects. The performance evaluations also demonstrate unchanged performances for real applications under 5% of cluster defects.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Corona anemometry using dual pin probe,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2735/,"Dau, Van ThanhDinh, Thien XuanBui, Thanh TungTerebessy, TiborBùi Thanh Tùng","In this paper, we present an experimental study on the anemometry characteristics of a bipolar corona discharge probe with symmetrically arranged parallel electrodes. The possibility of measuring a wide range of air flow rate/flow velocity has been demonstrated. The parallel pin probe simultaneously creates positive and negative corona discharge, decomposes air media at both electrodes while keeping them with charge balance ensured by the use of a single isolated power source. This feature is fundamentally different from other reported unipolar discharge configurations, where the decomposed gas and charge is created from single electrode. Under the existence of the air flow, the decomposed gas is redistributed towards the downstream electrode, and changes the current–voltage characteristics of the system. When the probe is in open space, the discharge current is reduced with increasing flow velocity. In constrained space the discharge current behaviour is similar at high flow rates above 25 l min−1, while at low flow rates this relation is reversed. In addition, the sensitivity of discharge current to change in air flow is much higher when the negative pin is placed downstream. Both open space and constrained space characteristics are explained in terms of the influence of external flow on the ozone distribution and its effect on the discharge current. This explanation is supported by ozone measurements, with the data showing good correlation between the discharge current and ozone concentration with respect to the external flow. The role of the electrode separation and discharge voltage is also investigated.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

In particular, the bi-directional functionally graded materials (2D-FGMs) introduced are expected to have more effective properties, consequently eliminating commonly awkward problems such as local stress concentrations and delamination. In this paper, buckling and bending behaviors of 2D-FGM plates, which are of great importance in the design and development of engineering applications, are numerically analyzed by a finite element model. The plate kinematics are described using a new third-order shear deformation plate theory (TSDT), without the need for special treatment of shear-locking effect and shear correction factors. The present TSDT theory based on rigorous kinematic of displacements, which is shown to be dominated over other preceding theories, is derived from an elasticity formulation, rather by the hypothesis of displacements. The materials are assumed to be graded in two directions and their effective properties are computed through the rule of mixture. The accuracy of the proposed approach assessed on numerical results is confirmed by comparing the obtained results with respect to reference published solutions. The effects of some numerical aspect ratios such as volume fraction, boundary conditions, thickness to length ratio, etc. on static deflections and critical buckling are numerically studied. The investigation of results confirms that such aforementioned aspect ratios have significant effects on the mechanical behaviors of plates.",Article,"Engineering Mechanics

Within a particular application, the optimal settings could even vary across the image pairs to be registered. It is, therefore, crucial to develop methods that provide insight into the effect of each tuning parameter in interaction with the other tuning parameters and allow a user to efficiently identify optimal parameter settings for a given pair of images. An exhaustive search over all possible parameter settings has obvious disadvantages in terms of computational costs and quickly becomes infeasible in practice when the number of tuning parameters increases, due to the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a method based on Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE). PCE is a method for sensitivity analysis that approximates the model of interest (in our case the registration of a given pair of images) by a polynomial expansion which can be evaluated very efficiently. PCE renders this approach feasible for a large number of input parameters, by requiring only a modest number of function evaluations for model construction. Once the PCE has been constructed, the sensitivity of the registration results to changes in the parameters can be quantified, and the user can simulate registration results for any combination of input parameters in real-time. The proposed approach is evaluated on 8 pairs of liver CT scans and the results indicate that PCE is a promising method for parameter sensitivity analysis in medical image registration.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-66182-7_39,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2017

Accurate and Low Complex Cell Histogram Generation by Bypass the Gradient of Pixel Computation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2746/,"Ho, Huy HungNguyen, Ngoc SinhBui, Duy HieuTran, Xuan TuProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a popular feature description for the purpose of object detection. However, HOG algorithm requires a performance system because of its complex operation set. Especially, the cell histogram generation is one of the most complex part, it uses inverse tangent, square, square root, floating point multiplication. In this paper, we propose an accurate and low complex cell histogram generation by bypass the gradient of pixel computation. It employs the bin’s boundary angle method to determine the two quantized angles. However, instead of choosing an approximate value of tan, the nearest greater and the nearest smaller of each tan values from ratio between pixel’s derivative in y and x direction are used. Magnitude of two bins are solutions of a system of two equations, which represent the equality of the gradient of a pixel and its two bins in both vertical and horizontal direction. The proposed method spends only 30 addition and 40 shift operations to identify two bins of a pixel. Simulation results show that the percentage error when reconstructing the difference in x and y direction are always less than 2% with 8-bit length of the fractional part. Additionally, manipulating the precision of gradient magnitude is very simple by pre-defined sine and cosine values of quantized angles. Synthesizing the hardware implementation presents that its area cost is 3.57 KGates with 45nm NanGate standard cell library. The hardware module runs at the maximum frequency of 400 MHz, and the throughput is 0.4 (pixel/ns) for a single module.

The proposed algorithm makes use of wind information and immediate odor gradient to enhance the performance of the MRS. A mechanism based on Artificial Potential Field (APF) is utilized to ensure non-collision movement of the robots. This method is tested by simulation on Matlab. Data for the test scenarios, all in large scales, are generated using Fluent. Nearly 2000 runs are carried out and the simulation results confirm the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness.",Conference or Workshop Item (Lecture),"Electronics and Communications

Hence, PZT films deposited on single-crystal niobium doped SrTiO3(111) substrates (Nb:STO) are promising to solve this issue thanks to the similar perovskite structure between PZT and STO. Essentially, Nb:STO material is a conductor, playing a part in both bottom electrode and epitaxial substrate. In this work, 200-nm-thick PZT films were successfully fabricated on Nb:STO substrates by a solution process. One obtained that PZT(111) peak started to appear on the Nb:STO substrate at a low annealing temperature of 450oC. Also, scanning electron microscopy observation shows smooth and homogeneous surface of PZT films on Nb:STO substrate with no grain boundary, which evidences for epitaxial-like growth of PZT thin films.

Several proposals for indoor positioning have been developed over the last decades, amongst them, WiFi fingerprinting based is considered as the most promissing approach. However, many challenges are still remained for improving the accuracy of indoor mobile object localization. This paper presents a novel approach for enhancement of WiFi fingerprinting based indoor positioning by using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model the measured Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) distributions. Since the measured data varies due to obstacles in indoor environments as well as user directions, the proposed approach is able to model the data distribution more precise than the previous popular approach which utilizes single Gaussian.

Adaptive Second-order Sliding Mode Control of UAVs for Civil Applications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2563/,"Hoang, Van TruongSingh, Ansu ManPhung, Manh DuongHa, QuangDr Manh Duong Phung","Quadcopters, as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have great potential in civil applications such as surveying, building monitoring, and infrastructure condition assessment. Quadcopters however are relatively sensitive to rotational noises so that their performance may be quickly downgraded in the case of inadequate control, system uncertainties and/or disturbances. In this study, we deal with the quadrotor control problem by proposing a new control scheme named the adaptive second-order quasi-continuous sliding mode control (adaptive 2-QCSM). The goal is to achieve robust attitude control for the task of monitoring and inspection of built infrastructure. We first formulate the mathematical model of the quadcopter, incorporating nonlinearity, strong coupling, uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. We then use a Lyapunov function to derive the adaptive 2-QCSM control laws. We further tune it to ensure finite-time reaching under these control laws. Extensive simulations have been carried out for evaluation. Results show that the proposed control scheme can attenuate chattering to obtain stable operations under large parameter variations and strong disturbance conditions.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2563/1/ISARC2017-Paper114.pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2017

In this scenario, frame rate up conversion (FRUC) solutions play an important role due to their benefits in both increasing the viewing quality experience and reducing the cost of video transmission. However, with the recent increase in video resolution, notably from Standard Definition (SD) to High Definition (HD) and ultra HD, FRUC now requires not only better interpolated frame quality but also lower FRUC time processing. Considering this problem, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning based adaptive search range solution to enable an effective FRUC mechanism. In the proposed adaptive search range solution, a set of spatial-temporal features are carefully defined and exploited to adaptively assign an appropriate search range value to each considered block, notably by formulating the search range adaptation as a classification problem and using the well-known support vector machine framework for the classification task. Experimental results conducted for a rich set of common video test sequences shows the advantages of the proposed adaptive search range solution, notably in both interpolated frame quality improvement and time processing reduction.",Article,Electronics and Communications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2586/1/IET_1st%20page.pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2017

However, the limitation of bandwidth, energy resources and the heterogeneity of devices, networks and environments have been asking for a more powerful video coding solution, which provides not only the high compression efficiency but also the flexible scalability capability. In this context, we propose a novel scalable video coding solution, particularly designed for surveillance video content, which typically contains low motion and static scenes, thus having high temporal redundancy. In the proposed video coding framework, the conventional video coding standard, i.e., High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is wisely combined with the emerging distributed coding paradigm and following a lay-ered coding approach to exploit the high temporal correlation between frames in surveillance video content.

Because femtocells have small coverage radius, typically from 15 to 30 meters, a femtocell user (FU) walking at low speed can still make several femtocell-to-femtocell handovers during its connection. When performing a femtocell-to-femtocell handover, femtocell selection used to select the target handover femtocell has to be able not only to reduce unnecessary handovers and but also to support FU’s quality of service (QoS). In the paper, we propose a femtocell selection scheme for femtocell-tofemtocell handover, named Mobility Prediction and Capacity Estimation based scheme (MPCE-based scheme), which has the advantages of the mobility prediction and femtocell’s available capacity estimation methods.

The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that move in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices of the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into adjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by attackers by occupying selected vertices. The team of defenders need to maintain connectivity of vertices occupied by its own agents in a visibility graph. The visibility graph models possibility of communication between pairs of vertices. We study strategies for allocating vertices to be occupied by the team of defenders to block attacking agents where connectivity is maintained at the same time. To do this we reserve a subset of defending agents that do not try to block the attackers but instead are placed to support connectivity of the team. The performance of strategies is tested in multiple benchmarks. The success of a strategy is heavily dependent on the type of the instance, and so one of the contributions of this work is that we identify suitable strategies for diverse instance types.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3793/1/%5B2018%20Flairs%5D%20Maintaining%20Ad-Hoc%20Communication%20Network%20in%20Area%20Protection%20Scenarios%20with%20Adversarial%20Agents.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2017

We first estimated field-level post-harvest rice residues, including separate fuel-loading factors for rice straw and rice stubble. Results suggested fuel-loading factors of 0.27 kg m−2 (±0.033), 0.61 kg m−2 (±0.076), and 0.88 kg m−2 (±0.083) for rice straw, stubble, and total post-harvest biomass, respectively. Using these factors, we quantified potential emissions from rice residue burning and compared our estimates with other studies. Our results suggest total rice residue burning emissions as 2.24 Gg PM2.5, 36.54 Gg CO and 567.79 Gg CO2 for Hanoi Province, which are significantly higher than earlier studies. We attribute our higher emission estimates to improved fuel-loading factors; moreover, we infer that some earlier studies relying on residue-to-product ratios could be underestimating rice residue emissions by more than a factor of 2.3 for Hanoi, Vietnam. Using the rice planted area data from the Vietnamese government, and combining our fuel-loading factors, we also estimated rice residue PM2.5 emissions for the entirety of Vietnam and compared these estimates with an existing all-sources emissions inventory, and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). Results suggest 75.98 Gg of PM2.5 released from rice residue burning accounting for 12.8% of total emissions for Vietnam. The GFED database suggests 42.56 Gg PM2.5 from biomass burning with 5.62 Gg attributed to agricultural waste burning indicating satellite-based methods may be significantly underestimating emissions.

This paper explores that character distribution models should be built at attribute level in order to achieve a reasonable accuracy. However, attaching detection models to every single attribute leads to high memory and time complexities, which make attribute-specific models less practical. To remove these barriers, a simple yet effective solution has been proposed. In more details, by exploiting the language function of characters, character distribution can be reduced in size and rearranged in an intentional manner so that both time and memory complexities are reduced significantly. Detection models that use minimized and rearranged character distribution are, therefore, highly efficient and practical, especially suitable to large, high-traffic web applications.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2017

Thus, it is important that a recommended item is relevant not only to the user, but also to the existing items in the basket. Towards this goal, we propose two approaches. First, we explore a factorization-based model called BFM that incorporates various types of associations involving the user, the target item to be recommended, and the items currently in the basket. Second, based on our observation that various recommendations towards constructing the same basket should have similar likelihoods, we propose another model called CBFM that further incorporates basket-level constraints.

However, only few empirical models have been estimated from restricted mitochondrial protein data of a hundred species. The existing models are unlikely to represent appropriately the amino acid substitutions from hundred thousands metazoan mitochondrial protein sequences. Results: We selected 125,935 mitochondrial protein sequences from 34,448 species in the metazoan kingdom to estimate new amino acid substitution models targeting metazoa, vertebrates and invertebrate groups. The new models help to find significantly better likelihood phylogenies in comparison with the existing models. We noted remarkable distances from phylogenies with the existing models to the maximum likelihood phylogenies that indicate a considerable number of incorrect bipartitions in phylogenies with the existing models. Finally, we used the new models and mitochondrial protein data to certify that Testudines, Aves, and Crocodylia form one separated clade within amniotes. Conclusions: We introduced new mitochondrial amino acid substitution models for metazoan mitochondrial proteins. The new models outperform the existing models in inferring phylogenies from metazoan mitochondrial protein data. We strongly recommend researchers to use the new models in analysing metazoan mitochondrial protein data.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

For complex object classification, multiple single classifiers are often used and they are concatenated into a multistage classification system. Thus, it is necessary to obtain the overal ROC curve, because the ROC curves of the individual classifiers are not useful for the overall system since it has multi-level decision thresholds. In this paper, a systematic approach was introduced for measuring the performance of multistage systems via estimating the overall ROC curve. Two new ROC models sharing the same properties of classical ROC curves were proposed, inspired by the Gaussian and logistic distributions.

PEH is a multilayer axisymmetric piezoceramic package. The dependence between the output voltage and the current load rate under the harmonic and nonstationary mechanical action of the PEH is studied. The experimental results-to-numerical calculation correlation has shown their good coincidence, which allows using the analyzed numerical models to optimize the PEH design at the given external action frequency and the active resistance value of the external electric circuit.

However, in cloud-prone areas, building high-resolution land-cover maps is still challenging due to infrequent satellite revisits and lack of cloud-free data. We propose a classification method for cloud-persistent areas with high temporal dynamics of land-cover types. First, compositing techniques are employed to create dense time-series composite images from all available Landsat 8 images. Then, spectral–temporal features are extracted to train an ensemble of five supervised classifiers. The resulting composite images are clear with at least 99.78% cloud-free pixels and are 20.47% better than their original images on average. We classify seven land classes, including paddy rice, cropland, grass/shrub, trees, bare land, impervious area, and waterbody over Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2016. Using a time series of composites significantly improves the classification performance with 10.03% higher overall accuracy (OA) compared to single composite classifications. Additionally, using time series of composites and the ensemble technique, which combines the best of five experimented classifiers (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel – SVM–RBF and Linear kernel – SVM–Linear, multilayer perceptron), performed best with 84% OA and 0.79 kappa coefficient.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431161.2017.1399477?journalCode=tres20,"Center of Multidisciplinary Integrated Technologies for Field Monitoring (FIMO)

Precision and recall oncology: combining multiple gene mutations for improved identification of drug-sensitive tumours,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2582/,"Naulaerts, StefanDang, Cao CuongBallester, PedroCao Cuong Dang","Cancer drug therapies are only effective in a small proportion of patients. To make things worse, our ability to identify these responsive patients before administering a treatment is generally very limited. The recent arrival of large-scale pharmacogenomic data sets, which measure the sensitivity of molecularly profiled cancer cell lines to a panel of drugs, has boosted research on the discovery of drug sensitivity markers. However, no systematic comparison of widely-used single-gene markers with multi-gene machine-learning markers exploiting genomic data has been so far conducted. We therefore assessed the performance offered by these two types of models in discriminating between sensitive and resistant cell lines to a given drug. This was carried out for each of 127 considered drugs using genomic data characterising the cell lines. We found that the proportion of cell lines predicted to be sensitive that are actually sensitive (precision) varies strongly with the drug and type of model used. Furthermore, the proportion of sensitive cell lines that are correctly predicted as sensitive (recall) of the best single-gene marker was lower than that of the multi-gene marker in 118 of the 127 tested drugs. We conclude that single-gene markers are only able to identify those drug-sensitive cell lines with the considered actionable mutation, unlike multi-gene markers that can in principle combine multiple gene mutations to identify additional sensitive cell lines. We also found that cell line sensitivities to some drugs (e.g. Temsirolimus, 17-AAG or Methotrexate) are better predicted by these machine-learning models.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

It has been widely applied in many fields such as dialogue systems, automatic machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and especially useful in systems with human-computer natural language dialogue interfaces such as virtual assistants and chatbots.

In this paper, we focus on segmenting the utterance according to the dialog act boundaries, i.e. functional segments identification, for Vietnamese utterances. We investigate carefully functional segment identification in two approaches: (1) machine learning approach using maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random fields (CRFs); (2) deep learning approach using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a CRF layer (Bi-LSTM-CRF) on two different conversational datasets: (1) Facebook messages (Message data); (2) transcription from phone conversations (Phone data).

Multicontext-adaptive indexing and search for large-scale video navigation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3786/,"Nguyen, Diep Thi-NgocKiyoki, YasushiMs Diep Nguyen Thi Ngoc","Many multimedia retrieval tasks are faced with increasingly large-scale datasets and variously changing preferences of users in each query. There are at least three distinctive contextual aspects comprised to form a set of preferences of a user at each query time: content, intention, and response time. A content preference refers to the low-level or semantic representations of the data that a user is interested in. An intention preference refers to how the content should be regarded as relevant. And a response time preference refers to the ability to control a reasonable wait time. This paper features the dynamic adaptability of a multimedia search system to the contexts of its users and proposes a multicontext-adaptive indexing and search system for video data. The main contribution is the integration of context-based query creation functions with high-performance search algorithms into a unified search system. The indexing method modifies inverted list data structure in order to construct disk-resident databases for large-scale data and efficiently enables a dynamic pruning search mechanism on those indices. We implement a frame-wise video navigation system as an application of the indexing and search system using the a 2.14 TB movie dataset. Experimental studies on this system show the effectiveness of the proposed pruning search method when dealing with dynamic contexts and its comparative high search performance.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Systematic assessment of multi-gene predictors of pan-cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs exploiting gene expression data,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2525/,"Nguyen, LinhDang, Cao CuongBallester, Pedro J.Cao Cuong Dang","Background: Selected gene mutations are routinely used to guide the selection of cancer drugs for a given patient tumour. Large pharmacogenomic data sets, such as those by Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) consortium, were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data. Methods: Here we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than standard k-fold cross-validation. Results and Discussion: Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by the multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG. Conclusions: Thanks to this unbiased validation, we now know that this type of models can predict in vitro tumour response to some of these drugs. These models can thus be further investigated on in vivo tumour models. R code to facilitate the construction of alternative machine learning models and their validation in the presented benchmark is available at http://ballester.marseille.inserm.fr/gdsc.transcriptomicDatav2.tar.gz.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,http://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.10529.2,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2017

As the complexity of video coding algorithm is rising, there are more demands for hardware accelerators and customized hardware. Context-based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) is the only entropy coding method adopted in the latest video compression standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Binary Arithmetic Encoder (BAE) is an essential component in CABAC, where the compression process happens. Because of the high data dependency and sequential coding characteristic, it is challenging to parallelize BAE. In this work, we proposed a low-cost and high-throughput hardware architecture for one core of BAE in HEVC. Our 4-stage pipelined BAE architecture is capable of processing one regular bin and up to 4 bypass bins per clock cycle with 30% reduction in terms of area when compared with the designs for one-core CABAC architecture. The design can compress an average of 1.4 bins per cycle.

NamNguyen, Vu TamDinh, Ngoc ThangHoàng Xuân Huấn","In this paper, we study crucial elements of a complex network, namely its nodes and connections, which play a key role in maintaining the network’s structure and function under unexpected structural perturbations of nodes and edges removal. Speciﬁcally, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose failure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected triples(or triangles)in the network. This problem is extremely important, because connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many real-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable data transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in mobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can greatly affect the network’s structure and disrupt its normal function, which can further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such crucial elements will shed light on key factors behind the resilience and robustness of many complex systems in practice. We formulate the analysis under multiple optimization problems and show their intractability. We next propose efﬁcient approximation algorithms, namely, DAK-n and DAK-e, which guarantee an (1 − 1/e)-approximate ratio (compared with the overall optimal solutions) while having the same time complexity as the best triangle counting and listing algorithm on power-lawnetworks.Thisadvantagemakes ouralgorithmsscaleextremelywellevenforverylargenetworks.Inanapplicationperspective,we perform comprehensive experiments on real social traces with millions of nodes and billions of edges.

However, the management of these systems gives rise to many problems. As the bike pick-up demands at different places are unbalanced at times, the systems have to be rebalanced frequently. Rebalancing the bike availability effectively, however, is very challenging as it demands accurate prediction for inventory target level determination. In this work, we propose two types of regression models using multi-source data to predict the hourly bike pick-up demand at cluster level: Similarity Weighted K-Nearest-Neighbor (SWK) based regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). SWK-based regression models learn the weights of several meteorological factors and/or taxi usage and use the correlation between consecutive time slots to predict the bike pick-up demand. The ANN is trained by using historical trip records of BSS, meteorological data, and taxi trip records. Our proposed methods are tested with real data from a New York City BSS: Citi Bike NYC. Performance comparison between SWK-based and ANN-based methods is provided.

However, the ARG4WG algorithm was not designed to optimize the number of recombination events.

The fuzzy controller is modified to contain only the fuzzification and inference procedures so that its output is a membership function representing the behavior’s objective.

The co-channel downlink interference to the MU might cause the MU’s QoS degradation. To maintain the QoS of the MU’s connection, the serving macro base station (MBS) has to increase the transmission power of the macrocell downlink. The power increment will also cause more co-channel interference to other MUs of the neighbor MBSs thus results in increasing downlink transmission power of the macrocell subsystem. In this paper, we analyze the co-channel downlink interference and then propose downlink channel reallocation schemes, denoted as MBS-sensing and CFAP-sensing schemes, in order to reduce the power consumption of the macrocell subsystem. Simulation results prove that using channel reallocation schemes provide much better downlink power consumption efficiency than the case when the channel reallocation is not deployed. In general, the CFAP-sensing scheme has better performance than the MBS-sensing scheme. However, when femtocells have long coverage radius, the MBS-sensing scheme is the better solution because it is less complex and has similar performance.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications > Communications,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2654/1/1570397665-%20Final%20Manuscript%20-%20NICS-Nafosted-2017-%20Nguyen%20Nam%20Hoang.docx,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2017

To address this problem, we propose efficient error concealment (EC) methods that conceal the whole frame lost and mitigate the error propagation problem occurred in practical video transmission using SHVC.

Today, as the amount of data on chemicals is increasing dramatically, QSAR methods have become pivotal for the purpose of handling the data, identifying a decision, and gathering useful information from data processing. The advances in this field have paved a way for numerous alternative approaches that require deep mathematics in order to enhance the learning capability of QSAR models. One of these directions is the use of Multiple Classifier Systems (MCSs) that potentially provide a means to exploit the advantages of manifold learning through decomposition frameworks, while improving generalization and predictive performance. In the present paper, we present MCS as a next generation of QSAR modeling techniques and discuss the chance to mining the vast number of models already published in the literature. We systematically revisited the theoretical frameworks of MCS as well as current advances in MCS application for QSAR practice. Furthermore, we illustrate our idea by describing ensemble approaches on modeling histone deacetylase (HDACs) inhibitors. We expect that our analysis would contribute to a better understanding about MCS application and its future perspectives for improving the decision making of QSAR models.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

In the training process, our algorithm exploits the specific features per prominent class label chosen by a greedy approach as an extension of LIFT algorithm, and unlabeled data consumption mechanism from TESC. In classification, the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1NN) is applied to select appropriate class labels for a new data instance.

The cylindrical shell is reinforced by outside stringers under torsional load in the thermal environment. The layers of FG coatings are assumed to be made by functionally graded materials (FGMS) combining of ceramic and metal phases and the core of the shell is made from homogeneous material. The classical shell theory based on the von-Karman assumptions is used to model the thin cylindrical shell. Using Galerkin's procedure and Airy stress function, the governing equations can be solved to obtain the closed-form solution for the critical buckling load and postbuckling load-deflection curves of simply supported shells.

Here, a vertex is considered as covered if it lies within a given distance of at least a vertex of a route. This article introduces a generalized variant of the m-CTP that we called the multi-vehicle multi-covering Tour Problem (mm-CTP). In the mm-CTP, a vertex must be covered at least not only once but several times. Three variants of the problem are considered. The binary mm-CTP where a vertex is visited at most once, the mm-CTP without overnight where revisiting a vertex is allowed only after passing through another vertex and the mm-CTP with overnight where revisiting a vertex is permitted without any restrictions. We first propose graph transformations to convert the last two variants into the binary one and focus mostly on solving this variant. A special case of the problem is then formulated as an integer linear program and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed. We also develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that provides high-quality solutions for the problem.

An important question in DVFS is how to change the voltage and frequency adaptable to the required performance of the system at run-time while reducing the power consumption as much as possible. Another problem is how a tool could quickly and efficiently validate or reject a NoC architecture employing DVFS. By integrating the Orion 2 power model, VNOC 2.0 simulator can be used as either a NoC simulation tool or a platform for implementing and investigating DVFS ideas. In this paper, we focus on developing a new solution for NoC architectures to save energy using fuzzy-logic algorithms. A controller is designed to predict the change of traffic load based on the fuzzy logic algorithm, then adjusts the voltage and frequency correspondingly to minimize the power consumption while keeping the performance of the whole system. An estimation of power consumption has been done by using VNOC 2.0 simulator. The simulation results show that our model can save up to 46% the power consumption of a 8x8 NoC.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

Light Field (LF) data is able to provide rich visual information such as scene rendering with changes in depth of field, viewpoint, and focal length. However, Light Field data usually associates to a critical problem - the massive data. Therefore, compressing LF data is one of the main challenges in LF research. In this context, we present in this paper a comparative study for compressing LF data with not only the widely used image/video coding standards, such as JPEG-2000, H.264/AVC, HEVC and Google/VP9 but also with the most recent image/video coding solution, the Joint Exploration Model. In addition, this paper also proposes a LF image coding flow, which can be used as a benchmark for future LF compression evaluation.

Our approach comprises two stages, data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles and image processing with histogram analysis. For the data collection, a 3D model of the monitored structure is first created by using vision-based sensors attached on the UAV. Based on the model developed, geometrical properties are extracted to generate way points necessary for navigating the UAV for image capturing of the structure of different materials, for example, concrete. From the images obtained, our next step is to stick them together using the overlapped field of view. We then create histograms of the stuck images and detect peaks based on cosine similarity. We finally identify a potential crack or surface defect as location of the histogram peaks. The whole process is automatically carried out so that the inspection time is significantly improved while minimising any safety hazards that may be encountered in the UAV inspection process.

Secrecy Performance of Cognitive Cooperative Industrial Radio Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3387/,"Quach, Xuan TruongTran, HungUhlemann, ElisabethTran, Truc MaiTrần Trúc Mai","Although cognitive radio networks (CRNs) were originally intended as a powerful solution to enhance spectrum utilization, it can also be used to improve reliability by avoiding interference in the 2.4 or 5 GHz band. Using multiple relay nodes in CRNs, the outage probability, i.e., the probability that the endto-end signal-to-noise ratio drops below a predefined threshold, can be reduced significantly. This implies that the probability that a message is not delivered within a specific time frame, can be kept below a required threshold, even when there are constraints on energy efficiency in terms of peak transmit power. This is particularly useful for industrial networks with realtime constraints. However, using CRNs may also reveal secret information to eavesdroppers (EAVs). Therefore, guaranteeing secure and reliable communications in CRNs is still a challenging problem. To this end, the secrecy performance of a proactive decode-and-forward relaying scheme in a cognitive cooperative radio network is investigated. More specifically, analytical as well as approximate expressions for the secrecy outage probability and probability of non-zero secrecy capacity are derived to evaluate the system performance. Numerical results show that the approximation tightly match the analytical results and simulations, and thus it can be used to provide a fast evaluation of the security and reliability of communications using a considered assignment of relay nodes in a cognitive cooperative radio network (CCRN). Consequently, our results enable to secure the communication, and increasing the reliability, availability, robustness, and maintainability of wireless industrial network, subject to various constraints from the CRN",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications > Communications

It is assumed that the shell’s properties depend on temperature and change according to the power functions of the shell thickness. The shell is reinforced by the eccentrically longitudinal and transversal stiffeners made of full metal. Equilibrium, motion, and compatibility equations are derived using Reddy’s higher order shear deformation shell theory and taking into account the effects of initial geometric imperfection and the thermal stress in both the shells and stiffeners. The Galerkin method is applied to determine load–deflection and deflection–time curves. For the dynamical response, motion equations are numerically solved using Runge–Kutta method. The nonlinear dynamic critical buckling loads are found according to the criterion suggested by Budiansky–Roth. The influences of inhomogeneous parameters, dimensional parameters, stiffeners, elastic foundations, initial imperfection, and temperature increment on the nonlinear static and dynamic stability of thick FGM double curved shallow shells are discussed in detail.

Deterministic compressive sampling for high-quality image reconstruction of ultrasound tomography,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2479/,"Tran Quang, HuyHuynh Huu, TueTon That, LongTran, Duc TanAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Background A well-known diagnostic imaging modality, termed ultrasound tomography, was quickly developed for the detection of very small tumors whose sizes are smaller than the wavelength of the incident pressure wave without ionizing radiation, compared to the current gold-standard X-ray mammography. Based on inverse scattering technique, ultrasound tomography uses some material properties such as sound contrast or attenuation to detect small targets. The Distorted Born Iterative Method (DBIM) based on first-order Born approximation is an efficient diffraction tomography approach. One of the challenges for a high quality reconstruction is to obtain many measurements from the number of transmitters and receivers. Given the fact that biomedical images are often sparse, the compressed sensing (CS) technique could be therefore effectively applied to ultrasound tomography by reducing the number of transmitters and receivers, while maintaining a high quality of image reconstruction. Methods There are currently several work on CS that dispose randomly distributed locations for the measurement system. However, this random configuration is relatively difficult to implement in practice. Instead of it, we should adopt a methodology that helps determine the locations of measurement devices in a deterministic way. For this, we develop the novel DCS-DBIM algorithm that is highly applicable in practice. Inspired of the exploitation of the deterministic compressed sensing technique (DCS) introduced by the authors few years ago with the image reconstruction process implemented using l 1 regularization. Results Simulation results of the proposed approach have demonstrated its high performance, with the normalized error approximately 90% reduced, compared to the conventional approach, this new approach can save half of number of measurements and only uses two iterations. Universal image quality index is also evaluated in order to prove the efficiency of the proposed approach. Conclusions Numerical simulation results indicate that CS and DCS techniques offer equivalent image reconstruction quality with simpler practical implementation. It would be a very promising approach in practical applications of modern biomedical imaging technology.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

However, the actual number of active users in massive MIMO are limited by pilots training via the coherence time of the communication channel which is inversely proportional to the user velocity. The current model applies this coherence time for every user to design multiuser massive MIMO, which might result in a suboptimal solution since the users usually move at different speeds in practice. In this paper, we investigate multiuser massive MIMO by taking into consideration the differences in user velocities. In particular, two multiuser models are proposed to maximize the per-user spectral efficiency and the number of served users, respectively. System capacity of the proposed models is provided in analytical expression.

In this paper, the feasibility of using Parylene-HT as a low-temperature deposition, high-uniformity coverage low-dielectric liner for copper-filled through-silicon vias (TSVs) in 3-D integration is investigated. In particular, the capability of embedding Parylene-HT in via-last fabrication process is validated through the demonstration of 100-μ m-depth bottom-up copper-filled TSVs. TSVs with Parylene-HT as a liner were realized through vias etching, parylene vapor deposition, and copper electroplating processes. The Parylene-HT deposition and copper electroplating processes were implemented at room temperature, such that thermal-related issue would be avoided and device reliability would be enhanced.

The stronger mechanical wave beam generated by the multiple input-IDT layers on the thin film (1 μm) Aluminum Nitride (AlN), consists of different-phase acoustic waves that can travel through a liquid medium. In contrast to the whole signal leaking into liquid medium as in typical SAW devices, the signal obtained at the receiver of the M-SAW device only has a decline in the Rayleigh component. The experimental results show that it is possible to interact with the liquid medium placed on the surface and extract information about the liquid volume based on the phase change.

Since 2011, Vietnam began to pay attention to NSDI. Till now, the is no significant progress in implementation of NSDI except a common research between World Bank and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on strategic planning of NSDI and another research on making policy for building NSDI. In this paper, we present our research on the construction of the Local SDI (LSDI) for the Northeast and the Northwest of Vietnam. Our hypothesis is that the success of this LSDI will be a good lesson for building NSDI in the future. The reason why we selected the Northeast and Northwest because it is a large area with a total area of approximately 115,700km2 that is nearly 1/3 of Vietnam. Moreover, the Northeast and the Northwest comprehensively contain of topographical and morphological characteristics of nature, economics and society of Vietnam. NSDI is considered consisting of seven components: (i) spatial data; (ii) standards; (iii) Access to data; (iv) technology; (v) policy – legislation; (vi) organization – institution; (vii) partnership. In this research we only focused on four technical components which are spatial data, standards, access to data and technology. We collected spatial data from three sources: (i) existing spatial data and framework spatial data from Government and Local Government; (ii) existing remote sensing data from the NASA, USGS; (iii) Update remote sensing data from MODIS/NPP ground station at our university. We used open source platforms for building LSDI. Regarding to the access to data, we have organized spatial data in a data warehouse architecture to develop BI (Business Intelligence) tools.

Applying design patterns, which is the common reusable solution of several kinds of problems, is widely adopted in refactoring. And, the combination of refactoring and design patterns has established a revolution approach in software re-engineering. It, however, raises a challenged issue that the software model may not preserve some cer- tain behavioral properties. In this paper, we propose a new approach to checking the consistency between original model and its evolution (the model after applying design pattern). To this aim, we employ Unified Modeling Language (UML) to modeling system, and Object Constraint Language (OCL) to represent the system requirement.

Investigation of the crystalline structure and electrical properties indicated that the PZT film, crystallized at 500 �C, was suitable for FGT fabrication because of a high (111) orientation, large remnant polarization of 38 mC/cm2 on SiO2/Si substrate and 17.8 mC/cm2 on glass, and low leakage current of 10�6 A/cm2.

Aspects of nondestructive detections using a magnetoelectric sensor,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2352/,"Do, Thi Huong GiangNguyen, Huu DucDr Giang Do","This article deals with the state-of-the-art techniques in the ﬁeld of nondestructive (and/or distance) detections. Illustrations are described for a wide range of applications from local evaluations of magnetic nanoparticles at a depth of several centimeters in the body during clinical interventions to blood pulse analysis and pipe and cable monitoring. Developments are implemented using a magnetoelectric based magnetic sensor with a long type sandwich Metglas/PZT/Meglas laminate composite of 1×15 mm2 dimension. In the resonant mode, the sensor exhibits a sensitivity better than 200 mV/Oe and a detection limit of 3×10−8 emu. This method can detect a spot with at least 50 µg iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles at a distance of about 10 mm from the skin surface. For the radial pulse analysis, thanks to the disturbance created by blood flowing through a localized magnetic field, not only the information of the heard rate, but also the radial blood flow waveforms are monitored (fig. 1), which strongly supports the traditional Chinese medicine. Moreover, this universal detector type can also be performed for locating wood, metal, copper, iron and live wires in the walls.

Low Residual Stress in Si Substrate of Annular-Trench-Isolated TSV,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2321/,"Feng, WeiBui, Thanh TungWatanabe, NaoyaAoyagi, MasahiroKikuchi, KatsuyaBùi Thanh Tùng","Driven by the need of reduced energy consumption in devices, 3D integration technology by through silicon via (TSV) attracts increasing interests. However, high thermal stress is induced by the large mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) among the different materials in TSV. The thermal stress is a serious reliability concern for TSV in 3D integration system. In order to solve the stress issues in 3D packaging technology with TSV, we proposed a structure as annular-trench-isolated (ATI) TSV with an extra Si ring between Cu core and SiO2 layer. In this paper, we presented the fabrication process of ATI TSV with two separate etching processes for the parylene-HT trench and solder core while remaining a Si ring between parylene-HT layer and solder core. Note that the trench is narrow with thickness of 2 Â¿Â¿m, and its aspect ratio (AR) is high as 7. We successfully deposited the insulator of parylene-HT material in the whole annular trench between Si substrate and Si ring. And the uniformity of deposited parylene-HT layer was observed clearly by 3D X-ray computed tomography method as CT scan. Considering the high aspect ratio of our TSV, difficulty was expected during the conventional process, such as barrier deposition and Cu electroplating. Therefore, solder injection was implemented for depositing the material into the vias of ATI TSV. In order to understand the stress level after fabrication process, the residual stress was investigated with validated simulation model. A lower residual stress in Si substrate was observed in ATI TSV than that of regular TSV due to less solder volume and the redistribution of stress by Si ring in ATI TSV. During thermal cycling, the stress level increased with temperature decreasing from 125Â¿Â¿C to -40Â¿Â¿C for both ATI and regular TSV. The residual stress measurement of ATI TSV will be performed in further work.",Conference or Workshop Item (Lecture),"annular-trench-isolated TSV, fabrication, fabrication process, Residual stress, Residual stresses, silicon, substrates, thermal stresses, through-silicon vias",,Electronics and Communications,2016

Reduction of thermal stress in the Si substrate is important for minimizing the deviations in the device characteristics. An annular-trench-isolated (ATI) structure was proposed for the TSV to solve the thermal issues, which occur during the three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuit (IC) integration, by stress redistribution. The concept of ATI TSV is based on retaining a Si-ring between the metal core and insulator layer during the fabrication process. We realized the ATI TSV using a via-last fabrication approach, with two deep silicon etching processes (Bosch processes) for the insulator layer and the metal core. Parylene-HT was utilized as the insulator to achieve high uniformity. With a vacuum-assisted filling system, the vias were filled with a solder material. ATI TSVs with diameters of 10 μm and 2-μm-thick Parylene-HT insulation layers were demonstrated. Studies on the thermal stress levels of the ATI TSV were carried out by finite-element method (FEM) simulation, along with comparisons with regular and annular TSVs. We revealed that the ATI TSV shows lower thermal stresses in the Si substrate than the regular and annular TSVs.

The effect of climate change leads to a series of dangerous phenomena, such as landslides. Landslides occur not only in the mountainous province, but also in Delta provinces, where hundreds of landslides are reported annually in the North-Western provinces of Vietnam. These events have catastrophic impact to the community as well as the economy. In mountainous areas, the conditions for landslides to occur are met frequently, especially after heavy rains or geological activity, causing harm to the community as well as damaging or destroying much needed infrastructure and key transport routes. However, in Vietnam, investment in mountainous regions has been often lower than in urban areas. The meteorology monitoring and forecasting systems are ill equipped and overloaded, so they cannot deliver earlier and more accurate forecasts for complex weather events, unable to provide timely warnings. It can be seen that in countries that landslide often occur, researchers have been trying to develop low cost and efficient landslide detection system. This paper precisely addressed the problems mentioned, by designing and implementing an efficient and reliable Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning (LMnE) system based on the 3G/2G mobile communication system, and a rain gauge at the field site along with a carefully FEM (finite element method) simulation using the rain density information on the server.

The use of data mining techniques to build models for credit scoring has been a hot topic in recent years. Classification problems often have a large number of features, but not all of them are useful for classification.

Mechanisms of sex determination and transmission ratio distortion in Aedes aegypti,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2069/,"Hoang, PhucTeo, Tze MinHo, Thien XuanVinh, Le SyAsso.Prof. Vinh Le","Background: More effective mosquito control strategies are urgently required due to the increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance. The sterile insect technique (SIT) and the release of insects carrying a dominant lethal allele (RIDL) are two proposed methods for environmentally-friendly, species-targeted population control. These methods may be more suitable for developing countries if producers reduce the cost of rearing insects. The cost of control programs could be reduced by producing all-male mosquito populations to circumvent the isolation of females before release without reducing male mating competitiveness caused by transgenes. Results: An RNAi construct targeting the RNA recognition motif of the Aedes aegypti transformer-2 (tra-2) gene does not trigger female-to-male sex conversion as commonly observed among dipterous insects. Instead, homozygous insects show greater mortality among m-chromosome-bearing sperm and mm zygotes, yielding up to 100 % males in the subsequent generations. The performance of transgenic males was not significantly different to wild-type males in narrow-cage competitive mating experiments. Conclusion: Our data provide preliminary evidence that the knockdown of Ae. aegypti tra-2 gene expression causes segregation distortion acting at the level of gametic function, which is reinforced by sex-specific zygotic lethality. This finding could promote the development of new synthetic sex distorter systems for the production of genetic sexing mosquito strains.

In this paper, we present MPBoot, a new method for approximating MP bootstrap based on the idea of a previously introduced method for maximum likelihood bootstrap. MPBoot economizes the computations by only sampling trees on the original alignment and simultaneously calculating exact parsimony scores for all bootstrap alignments. Preliminary experiments on simulated data showed that MPBoot is about 2-3.5 times faster and yields better parsimony scores than a fast bootstrap procedure implemented in TNT. MPBoot also produced less biased support value than TNT for small simulated data sets (<;= 200 sequences). However, for large number of sequences (>=500) MPBoot overestimates the probability that a clade is true, i.e., results in likely high false positive rates.

Extremum Seeking Control based MPPT for photovoltaic array under uniform and non-uniform irradiances,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2202/,"Hoang, Van ManhNguyen, Ngoc VietPham, Manh ThangVan Manh Hoang","In order to extract the maximum power from photovoltaic (PV) array, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technology has always been applied in PV systems. The Perturb and Observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance (INC) methods are the most popular and widely used under the constant irradiance. However, the changes of the environmental parameters, such as cloud cover or the building block, will lead to the radiation change and then have a direct effect on the location of Maximum Power Point (MPP). In order to carry out MPPT in PV array under Partial Shading Conditions (PSCs), a method based on Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) is applied to determine the optimal value of a reference current in the PV system. The proposed ESC approach for the Global Maximum Power Point Tracking (GMPPT) in this work uses a series combination of a High Pass Filter (HPF) and two Low Pass Filters (LPFs). These three filters act as two Band Pass Filters (BPFs) and let a specific frequency of input power which includes the derivative of PV with respect to its voltage pass through. This auto-tuning strategy was developed to maximize the PV array output power through the regulation of the voltage input to the DC-DC boost converter in order to lead the PV array steady-state to a stable oscillation behavior around the Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP). The performance of the proposed ESC algorithm is evaluated by comparing it with the conventional ESC and modified P&O method in terms of tracking speed and accuracy by utilizing MATLAB SIMULINK. The simulation results demonstrate that the tracking capability of the proposed ESC algorithm is superior to that of the conventional ESC and modified P&O algorithm, particularly under low radiance and sudden mutation irradiance conditions.

Improving SHVC Performance with a Joint Layer Coding Mode,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1689/,"Hoang, Van XiemAscenso, JoaoAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","The growing need for a powerful scalable video coding engine targeting the heterogeneous landscape of network, devices, and consumption environments has led to the development of the Scalable High Efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) standard, an extension of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. To improve the SHVC compression efficiency, this paper proposes a novel joint layer coding mode to be integrated in the SHVC codec. In the proposed coding mode, the base layer (BL) and enhancement layer (EL) decoded information are linearly combined at the pixel level to create an additional coding mode. To fuse the BL and EL driven predictions, a weighting term is defined to indicate the contributions of each of them for the final joint layer prediction. To reach high adaptability, these weights are computed at pixel level in the prediction unit. Moreover, to achieve the highest compression efficiency, the proposed joint layer coding mode is adaptively selected using a rate distortion optimization (RDO) mechanism. Experiments conducted for a rich set of test conditions have shown that significant compression efficiency gains can be achieved with the proposed joint layer coding mode, notably up to 4.3 % in BD-Rate savings regarding the standard SHVC quality scalable codec.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial – temporal feature extraction based adaptive search range for effective FRUC. In the proposed adaptive search range scheme, a set of temporal and spatial features are carefully defined and exploited to adaptively assign an appropriate search range value to each considered block; thus, directly reducing the FRUC time processing.

The encoding complexity and the error sensitivity associated to the efficient HEVC coding tools adopted in SHVC make this scalable codec less attractive to some emerging applications such as video surveillance, visual sensor network, and remote space transmission where these requirements are critical. To address the requirements of these application scenarios including scalability, this paper proposes a novel HEVC based framework offering quality scalability on top of a HEVC compliant base layer while appropriately combining the predictive and distributed coding paradigms. To achieve the best enhancement layer compression efficiency, two novel coding tools are proposed, notably a machine learning based side information creation mechanism and an adaptive correlation modeling process. The experimental results reveal that the rate-distortion performance of the proposed DSVC-HEVC solution outperforms the relevant alternative coding solutions, notably by up to 52.9% and 23.7% BD-rate gains regarding the HEVC-Simulcast and SHVC standard solutions, respectively, for an equivalent prediction configuration, while achieving a lower encoding complexity.",Article,Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1781/1/a%20HEVC%20based%20Framework%20Combining%20the%20Predictive%20and%20Distributed%20Para...pdf,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),2016

Formal analysis of imprecise system requirements with Event‑B,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1900/,"Le, Hong AnhShin, NakajimaTruong, Ninh ThuanProf. Ninh Thuan Truong","Formal analysis of functional properties of system requirements needs precise descriptions. However, the stakeholders sometimes describe the system with ambiguous, vague or fuzzy terms, hence formal frameworks for modeling and verifying such requirements are desirable. The Fuzzy If–Then rules have been used for imprecise requirements representation, but verifying their functional properties still needs new methods. In this paper, we propose a refinement-based modeling approach for specification and verification of such requirements. First, we introduce a representation of imprecise requirements in the set theory. Then we make use of Event-B refinement providing a set of translation rules from Fuzzy If–Then rules to Event-B notations. After that, we show how to verify both safety and eventuality properties with RODIN/EventB.

First, individual fitness evaluation depends on the current Pareto front, specifically on the ratio of its dominated hyper-volume to the current Pareto front hyper-volume, hence giving an indication of how close the individual is to the current Pareto front. Second, a ranking strategy classifies individuals based on their fitness instead of Pareto dominance, individuals within the same rank are non guaranteed to be mutually non-dominated. Third, a crowding assignment mechanism that adapts according to the individual's neighbouring area, controlled by the neighbouring area radius parameter, and the archive of non-dominated solutions. We perform extensive experiments on the multiple 0/1 knapsack problem using different greedy repair methods to compare the performance of HVEA to other MOEAs including NSGA2, SEAMO2, SPEA2, IBEA and MOEA/D.

Using MVD, color videos with only a limited number of real viewpoints are compressed and transmitted along with captured or estimated depth videos. Because the synthesized views are generated from decoded real views, their original reference views do not exist at either the transmitter or receiver. Therefore, it is challenging to define an efficient metric to evaluate the quality of synthesized images. We propose a novel metric—the reduced-reference quality metric. First, the effects of depth distortion on the quality of synthesized images are analyzed. We then employ the high correlation between the local depth distortions and local color characteristics of the decoded depth and color images, respectively, to achieve an efficient depth quality metric for each real view. Finally, the objective quality metric of the synthesized views is obtained by combining all the depth quality metrics obtained from the decoded real views.

We carefully conducted an empirical evaluation for our model on a medium–sized collection of posts in Vietnamese and achieved promising results with an average accuracy of more than 90%.

A Watermark Algorithm Against De-Synchronization Attacks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2106/,"Luong, Viet NguyenTrinh, Nhat TienHo, Van CanhDr Ngoc Thang Bui","In this paper, a robust method to the ability of the watermark to resist against attacks is proposed for hiding information into images. The proposed method is blind because the original image is not required at the decoder to recover the embedded data. The robustness of the watermarking scheme is inspired by using a PJND (Pyramidal Just Noticeable Difference) model and the message is inserted into these DoG (Difference of Gaussians) [1, 2]. Our proposal takes into account three main characteristics of Human Visual System, namely: contrast sensitivity, luminance adaptation and contrast marking. Therefore, it not only provides an invisible and robust watermarking but also optimizes watermarking capacity. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated by a series of experiments with different input images. In terms of transparency, besides using the subjective experiments, eight objective metrics are calculated in comparison with other methods such as PSNR, MSSIM, SVDm, etc. Our approach always presents the outperform values. In terms of robustness, many kinds of attacks from global transformation (rotation, scaling, etc) to local transformation (stirmark, checkmark benchmarks, de-synchronization attacks) are implemented. Many image processing tools are applied to simulate the attacks such as Print-Screen, Using Photo editing software, Camcorder, Print-Scan, etc. The experimental results show an outstanding robustness in resisting these attacks.",Article,Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2106/1/116-466-1-PB.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2016

These parameters can be estimated from the measurement of particle velocities of shear wave propagation which is generated by a vibrating needle at a certain frequency. For the heterogeneous medium, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) is an effective method to present the shear wave propagation. The elasticity and viscosity are then estimated using the algebraic Helmholtz inversion (AHI) algorithm. However, there is a lack of deep investigation of estimation by combining FDTD method and AHI algorithm. Thus, this paper presents a complete system which includes the principle of excitation and measurement, the FDTD to model the shear wave propagation, the AHI algorithm to estimate the elasticity and viscosity, and the investigation on frequency-dependent the elasticity and viscosity. Also, we suggest that the excitation frequency of 200 Hz will offer the best estimation of the elasticity and viscosity.",Conference or Workshop Item (Lecture),Elasticity;Estimation;Finite difference methods;Frequency measurement;Propagation;Time-domain analysis;Viscosity,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2170/1/1570301422hai.pdf,Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering,2016

Relationships among five elements are considered in the home simulation. To validate the performance of the proposed home simulation, a real experimental house is used to conduct the experiment. The results showed the ability of the proposed home simulation to simulate the thermal energy and estimate the temperature of various rooms with an error of 1.2 degrees Celsius.

Although the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test is widely used to screen for PCa, certain advisory groups recommend against its use because it suffers from false positive results and over-treatment. These drawbacks have led to the increased interest of using metabolite profiling to discover new differential biomarkers that could improve the specificity of PCa diagnosis.1 In this work,2 untargeted metabolomic profiling of age-matched serum samples from PCa patients and healthy individuals was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry and machine learning methods. PCa was detected in serum samples with 92.1% sensitivity, 94.3% specificity, and 93.0% accuracy by means of a metabolite-based in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay, which outperformed the prevalent PSA test. Within the panel of 40 metabolic spectral features that was found to be differential, 31 metabolites were identified by MS and MS/MS, with 10 further confirmed by standards. Numerous discriminant metabolites were mapped in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. The identification of fatty acids, amino acids, lysophospholipids, and bile acids provided further insights into the metabolite alterations associated with the disease. Our current work involves the prospective analysis of a larger sample cohort (n=500) that includes samples from PCa patients before and after undergoing surgery, patients with benign prostatitis, and healthy individuals with measured PSA values, in order to evaluate the influence of ethnicity and cohort size on the robustness of the metabolic biomarker panel that we have previously found, and to discover biomarkers useful for follow-up care.",Conference or Workshop Item (Speech),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2405/1/Rosario2016-MongeME.doc,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2016

Understanding that the essence of critical thinking presents in the flows of questions and answers and aiming at a tool of augmenting it, we propose a new knowledge representation model based on bipartite graphs and a set of functions aided to explore those graphs. A bipartite graph has two disjoint vertex sets that are question and answer sets. Every edge connects a question to an answer holds an evidence for the answer and every edge connects an answer to a question holds an argument raised from the answer. The directional search mechanism is particularly designed to reuse reasoning flows in the debate graphs by a projecting function between the question and answer sets. We also introduce a framework placing the model and the search mechanism altogether in collaborative applications. Many philosophical debates are collected to demonstrate the advantages of the bigraph model besides its simplicity.

This paper proposes a standardization procedure which try to detect unusual values and fill in missing data. Experiments were conducted for PM10 data. Two datasets measured in 01/2011 and 01/2012 at Nguyen Van Cu station in Hanoi, Vietnam is used for experiments. For the abnormal detection process, unusual data can be informed to the data analyzers at ground stations for judging. For the missing filling process, the first dataset is used as training dataset to construct regression models for predicting missing data, the second dataset is used as testing data. In the worst case, suppose 100% PM10 is missing, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are 51 µg/m3 and 45% respectively. Correlation coefficient (R) between original PM10 data and predicted PM10 data is 0.56. In addition, different scenarios taking account of percentage of missing data of the whole testing dataset are also considered. Experimental results showed that it is best to perform missing filling process on datasets that contain 10% to 30% of missing data.

A calculation method is proposed for light beam configuration which guarantees no blind areas in the whole VLC coverage while minimizing the number of light beams. As a major contribution in this paper, a light beam allocation algorithm is proposed which aims to eliminate interferences between inter VLC Access Points (inter-APs) by using information of incoming data queue length and co-channel interference (CCI) conditions to decide which VLC beams are used for transmitting data to appropriate user equipments (UEs). By deploying the proposed algorithm, CCI can be eliminated because noise-effected regions and noise-free regions can be separated. Performance of the novel light beam allocation algorithm is analyzed, evaluated and then compared with that of another light beam allocation method using the Round-Robin algorithm.

An Efficient Implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard on the Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Architecture,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1484/,"Nguyen, Kiem HungTran, Xuan TuProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is currently considered as one of the best symmetric-key block ciphers. The hardware implementation of the AES for hand-held mobile devices or wireless sensor network nodes is always required to meet the strict constraints in terms of performance, power and cost. Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures are recently proposed as the solution that provides high flexibility, high performance and low power consumption for the next-generation embedded systems. This paper presents a flexible, high-performance implementation of the AES algorithm on a coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture, called MUSRA (Multimedia Specific Reconfigurable Architecture). First, we propose a hardware-software partitioning method for mapping the AES algorithm onto the MUSRA. Second, the parallel and pipelining techniques are considered thoughtfully to increase total computing throughput by efficiently utilizing the computing resources of the MUSRA. Some optimizations at both loop transformation level and scheduling level are performed in order to make better use of instruction-, loop- and task- level parallelism. The proposed implementation has been evaluated by the cycle-accurate simulator of the MUSRA. Experimental results show that the MUSRA can be reconfigured to support both encryption and decryption with all key lengths specified in the AES standard. The performance of the AES algorithm on the MUSRA is better than that of the ADRES reconfigurable processor, Xilinx Virtex-II, and the TI C64+ DSP.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

And then the MEH-PPV/PVK composites were doped with ZnO NPs with the mass-ratio of 10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt% of total weight blended polymers.

However, O-MIMO systems are faced with the impact of InterChannel Interference (ICI) which results in system performance decrease. In this paper, a novel Index-based Optical Spatial Modulation (IOSM) is proposed to remove ICI and increase spectrum efficiency for indoor VLC systems applying O-MIMO. In our proposed scheme, the signals are DC biased for intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) and a Maximumlikelihood (ML) decoder decision to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver.

In this study, we focus on the use of multi-annealing method, for which each layer was annealed at a suitable temperature, instead of a conventional annealing way, by means of a rapid thermal annealing system, in order to improve the film quality. The crystalline structure and surface morphology of the ITO thin films were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer, atomic force microscope (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). It has been obtained that all of ITO films exhibit a single phase with (200)- and (444)-preferred orientations. The AFM and SEM observations show that the particle size of ITO films was about 10 nm and the ITO film thickness was 180 nm, respectively. In sequence, the electrical properties of ITO thin films were evaluated by using four-point probe and Hall effect measurement methods, and the optical properties were investigated by UV/VIS spectrometer. The achievement results show that the optimum ITO films possessed electrical resistivity of 2.6 × 10-3 Ωcm and transparency higher than 90%, which strongly supports to the application of electrode in solar cell, LED or transistor devices from viewpoints of low-cost production and low-energy consumption.",Article,Engineering Physics,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2633/1/Journal%20of%20Science%20and%20Tech%202016%20%28Hoa%29.pdf,Faculty of Engineering Physics and Nanotechnology (FEPN),2016

Two popular DHT-based approaches for range or multi-attribute search are to rely on attribute-value tree and a combination of attributes and values. However, tradeoff between a load balancing mechanism and query efficiency is a challenging task for such information searching systems. In this paper, we propose improved algorithms for a system called DSMAV in which information resources are distributed fairly among nodes and found based on multi-attribute queries in a small number of hop counts. Our system creates identifiers from resource names, each of which is a combination of attribute-value pairs (AV pairs). In order to overcome problem of load imbalance among nodes because of frequent appearance of AV pairs in many resource names, we control the quantity of information resources distributed to a node based on load capacity of each node. Moreover, periodical updating processes on a node enable our load balancing mechanism to be maintained accurately. As a result, our improvement evaluated by simulated results depicts a good degree of load balance as well as query efficiency.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

Nevertheless, most current ARG inference algorithms are only applicable to small data sets due to their computational burden. Margarita by Minichiello and Durbin [1] can handle larger data sets; however, it is still not feasible at genome scale. We hereby propose a heuristic algorithm, called ARG4WG, to construct plausible ARGs from thousands of whole chromosome samples, in which the so-called longest shared end, i.e. the longest match between left or right ends of sequences, is used for recombination in the building process. This strategy allows ARG4WG to significantly reduce the computational cost, by working hundreds to thousands times faster than Margarita. ARG4WG leads to ARGs with fewer numbers of recombination events on real data sets. Margarita is slightly better than ARG4WG in reconstructing tree topology on simulated data. The ARGs resulted from our algorithm also performed reasonably well in an association study with 5560 haplotypes across a whole Chromosome 11 of the Gambia dataset. These results indicate that ARG4WG is a good candidate for genome-wide association study from large data sets.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

In this work, we discuss the physics of the ground-state phase diagram of a two- dimensional Kagome lattice spin-1/2 XY model with a four-site ring-exchange interaction using quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We found the second order phase transition from superfluid state to a Z2 quantum spin liquid phase driven by the four-site ring exchange interaction. We have characterized the QSL by its vanishing order parameters such as the spin-spin structure factor, the plaquette-plaquette structure factor.

A hybrid approach to Vietnamese word segmentation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2401/,"Nguyen, Tuan PhongLe, Anh CuongTuan-Phong Nguyen","Word segmentation is the very first task for Vietnamese language processing. Word-segmented text is the input of almost other NLP tasks. This task faces some challenges due to specific characteristics of the language. As in many other Asian languages such as Japanese, Korean and Chinese, white spaces in Vietnamese are not always used as word separators and a word may contain one or more syllables. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid approach to detect word boundary for Vietnamese texts using logistic regression as a binary classifier combining with longest matching algorithm. First, longest matching algorithm is used to catch words that contain more than two syllables in input sentence. Next, the system utilizes the classifier to determine the boundary of 2-syllable words and proper names. Then, the predictions having low confidence conducted by the classifier are verified by a dictionary to get the final result. Our system can achieve an F-measure of 98.82% which is the most accurate result for Vietnamese word segmentation to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the system also has a high speed.

Trong khi đó các trang tin tức khác trên mạng thường đăng tải các thông tin này chậm hơn. Thậm chí, nhiều thông tin được đăng tải trên các trang mạng xã hội nhưng không được đăng tải qua các trang tin tức khác. Tin tức, thông tin, sự kiện sẽ có giá trị cao khi nó được truyền tải đến người dùng nhanh và chính xác. Vậy làm thế nào để tự động phát hiện, tập hợp nhanh các sự kiện đó và trả lời được các câu hỏi “sự kiện gì, xảy ra ở đâu? thời gian nào? diễn biến của sự kiện đó như thế nào?...” cho người dùng? Trong nghiên cứu này, chúng tôi muốn xây dựng một hệ thống phát hiện và theo dõi các sự kiện thông qua việc sử dụng dữ liệu là các tin tức (news) trên các trang mạng, các bình luận (comment), các bài (post) trên mạng xã hội Facebook và ngôn ngữ của các dữ liệu này là tiếng Việt.",Conference or Workshop Item (Poster),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1539/1/poster%20of%20Nguyen%20Xuan%20Toi.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2016

In this paper, we present a novel approach based on string matching to take into account geometric correspondences between images and facilitate category recognition. First, we propose to represent images as strings of histogram second, we introduce a new string distance in the context of image comparison. This distance automatically identifies local alignments between sub image regions and allows merging groups of similar sub-regions.

How Reliable Are Ligand-Centric Methods for Target Fishing?,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2577/,"Peon, AntonioDang, Cao CuongBallester, PedroCao Cuong Dang","Computational methods for Target Fishing (TF), also known as Target Prediction or Polypharmacology Prediction, can be used to discover new targets for small-molecule drugs. This may result in repositioning the drug in a new indication or improving our current understanding of its efficacy and side effects. While there is a substantial body of research on TF methods, there is still a need to improve their validation, which is often limited to a small part of the available targets and not easily interpretable by the user. Here we discuss how target-centric TF methods are inherently limited by the number of targets that can possibly predict (this number is by construction much larger in ligand-centric techniques). We also propose a new benchmark to validate TF methods, which is particularly suited to analyse how predictive performance varies with the query molecule. On average over approved drugs, we estimate that only five predicted targets will have to be tested to find two true targets with submicromolar potency (a strong variability in performance is however observed). In addition, we find that an approved drug has currently an average of eight known targets, which reinforces the notion that polypharmacology is a common and strong event. Furthermore, with the assistance of a control group of randomly-selected molecules, we show that the targets of approved drugs are generally harder to predict.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

The decentralised control is originally built up by behavioural control but upgraded with decentralised robot control for connectivity maintenance and decentralised connectivity control for hierarchical connectivity removal, allowing the network expansion for tracking and occupying spatially distributed targets. The multi-target tracking algorithm guarantees that the mobile robots reach targets at very high efficiency, while at least an interconnectivity network connecting all the mobile robots is preserved for information exchange. The Monte Carlo simulation results illustrate characteristics of the decentralised control as well as its scalability through several experimental scenarios.",Book Section,"Electronics and Communications

Nonlinear dynamic and stability analysis of ES-FGM plates on elastic foundation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1566/,"Pham, Hong CongNguyen, Dinh DucDr Ngoc Thang Bui","Since its first introduction in 1984 by a group of material scientists in Japan, functionally graded materials (FGMs) have attracted considerable attention in many engineering applications namely extremely high temperature resistant materials. Eccentrically stiffened FGM (ES-FGM) was firstly studied in 2011 [1]. After that, ES-FGM was attracted and studied more by many authors; however, their studies mainly used classical theory and did not study the effects of temperature on stiffeners. This paper presents an analytical approach to investigate the nonlinear dynamic response and stability analysis of centrically stiffened FGM plates on elastic foundation using both of the first order shear deformation plate theory and stress function. The ES-FGM plates are assumed to rest on elastic foundation and subjected to mechanical, thermal loads in thermal environment.",Conference or Workshop Item (Poster),Engineering Mechanics,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1566/1/Poster_NCS_PhamHongCong_14028015-1.pdf,Faculty of Engineering Mechanics and Automation (FEMA),2016

However, an normal electrocardiography can not eliminate absolutely the heart disease. For example, in the case our heart rate is irregular and appears intermittently, if ECG is mearsured between the attacks, it will be normally. Also, not all cases of myocardial infarction were detected by normal ECG and angina is a typical case. At that time, we will need to consider a special ECG – Stress (Exercise) Echocardiography. Stress echo is done as part of a stress test. During a stress test, patients exercise or take medicine (given by doctor) to make their heart work hard and beat fast. A technician will use echo to create pictures of patients’ heart before they exercise and as soon as they finish. Some heart problems, such as coronary heart disease, are easier to diagnose when the heart is working hard and beating fast. To meet the demands of this procedure, a stress electro-cardiogram instrumentation wil be used in order to observe and store the whole process. Generally, such this system consists of three main units: exercise equipment (treadmill/stationary bicycle), special ECG device and a supported computer system. By considering appropriate components, a stress ECG instrumentation can be designed and integrated completely.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Engineering Mechanics,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2345/1/Stress%20Electro-Cardiography%20Instrumentation%20-%20Principles%20and%20Structure.doc,Faculty of Engineering Mechanics and Automation (FEMA),2016

Efficient Region-of-Interest Based Adaptive Bit Allocation for 3D-TV Video Transmission over Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1746/,"Pham, Nam ThanhVu, Khuong DuyDinh, Duong TrieuLe, Ha ThanhAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Due to characteristics of human visual system (HVS), people usually focus more on a specific region named region-of-interest (ROI) of a video frame, rather than watch the whole frame. In addition, ROI-based video coding can also help to effectively reduce the number of encoding bitrates required for video transmission over networks, especially for the 3D-TV transmissions. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel ROI-based bit allocation (BA) method which can adaptively extract and increase the visual quality of ROI while saving a huge number of encoding bitrates for video data. In the proposed method, we first detect and extract ROI based on the depth information obtained from 3D-TV video coding sequences. Then, based on the extracted ROI, a novel BA scheme is performed to solve the rate-distortion (R-D) optimization problem, in which the higher priority bitrates are adaptively assigned to ROI while the total encoding bitrates of video frames are kept satisfying all constraints required by the R-D optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides much better higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as compared to other conventional BA methods.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Therefore, lack of PUFA could lead to abnormalities in skin, kidney, neural networks, immune responses and inflammation; cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory and reproductive systems. In fish oil, PUFA content were low, thus it was difficult to produce on a large scale. Therefore, the exploration of PUFA sources particularly as arachidonic acid-AA, eicosapentaenoic acid EPA, docosapentaenoic acid-DPA/DHA attracted many researches. Heterotrophic microalgae Thraustochytrids were capable of producing high amounts of DHA and PUFA composition varied. DHA can be synthesized by the metabolism of AA, EPA and DPA. The different types of PUFA reflected relationships in classification. Ten heterotrophic microalgae thraustochytrids isolated from mangrove Xuan Thuy, Nam Dinh contain fatty acid composition varied from C12 to C28. Especially, they had two important fatty acids of PUFA as EPA and DPA. Polyunsaturated fatty acids - PUFA content of ten thraustochytrid strains were from 28.95 to 49.62% total lipid. DPA compared to other PUFA were high for all thraustochytrid strains studied, accounting 20.22 to 39.35% TFA. Ten thraustochytrid strains had the highest growth with carbon source as glucose, total lipid reached 7 to 12.35 % dry weight biomass after 72 hours. Growth rate and lipid biosynthesis in organic nitrogen source were higher than in inorganic nitrogen sources.

Tuy nhiên, trong quá trình đo đạc về mức độ sử dụng tối ưu tần số đã chỉ ra rằng phần lớn các dải tần cấp phát đang bị sử dụng một cách kém hiệu quả, mà nguyên nhân bao gồm việc cách cấp phát, quản lý và khai thác kém hiệu quả . Để tận dụng một cách hiệu quả các dải tần số, một phương pháp sử dụng và quản lý các dải tần số mới được được đề xuất bởi J Mitola với tên gọi mạng vô tuyến nhận thức - Cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Giải pháp này được xem như là một bước tiên phong cho các thế hệ tiếp theo của mạng không dây. Tuy nhiên, CRNs cũng đối mặt với những thách thức. Việc đánh giá, lựa chọn và quản lý phổ tần như thế nào để phù hợp cho nhu cầu truyền hiện tại của các đối tượng trong hệ thống mạng là một trong những thách thức không nhỏ đối với CRNs. Mặt khác, với tính chất truyền thông quảng bá tự nhiên của các mạng không dây nói chung, bất kỳ người nhận nào trong phạm vi của một truyền dẫn không dây đều có khả năng nghe được thông tin truyền đi. Do đó, bảo mật thông tin là mối quan tâm then chốt trong các mạng không dây. Do có độ phức tạp và độ trễ thấp, cũng như tính khả thi ở lớp vật lý và khả năng cùng tồn tại với các cơ chế bảo mật mã hóa hiện có mà nó có thể nâng cao mức độ tổng thể về an toàn thông tin. Vì vậy, bảo mật ở lớp vật lý đã và đang thu hút được sự quan tâm nghiên cứu của các học giả trên khắp thế giới trong thời gian gần đây.

The Efficiency of Applying Compressed Sampling and Multi-Resolution into Ultrasound Tomography,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1563/,"Tran, Quang HuyTran, Duc TanDr Ngoc Thang Bui","Ultrasound tomography would allow ultrasound imaging to reach its full potential, compared to X-ray, MRI, etc. It is based on inverse scattering and has the capability to detect structures whose sizes are smaller than the wavelength of the incident wave, as opposed to conventional one using pulse-echo technique. Some material properties such as sound contrast and attenuation are very useful to detect small objects. The Distorted Born Iterative Method (DBIM) based on first-order Born approximation is an efficient diffraction tomography approach. The compressed sensing technique is utilized for the DBIM to obtain the high-quality ultrasound image. However, the image reconstruction process is quite long. In this paper, we proposed an approach to enhance the imaging quality and to reduce the imaging time by applying the compressed sensing technique along with the multi-resolution technique for the DBIM.

This uses multiple frequencies for producing images, leading to large computational complexity and storage space (i.e. for each frequency, NtNrN2 calculations are required). It is a main barrier that the FH-DBIM approach is not fully exploited in commercialized devices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an alternative algorithm for significant reducing the computational complexity of the FH-DBIM by integrating compressed sensing and frequency hopping techniques for the DBIM. That is, the needed number of measurements for imaging is tremendously reduced in comparison with the conventional one.

A popular method introduced in ultrasound tomography is the Distorted Born Iterative Method (DBIM). Recently, the dual-frequency combination technique has been utilized to improve the reconstruction quality and increase the convergence rate of the DBIM. This method uses two frequencies, f_1 (low) and f_2 (high), to estimate the sound contrast in N_f1 and N_f2 iterations, respectively. However, the influence of these iteration parameters on the overall performance of the system is not yet known. In this paper, it is shown by using the simulation technique that if we do not pay attention to the choice of these parameters, the reconstruction quality might be worse than that using a single frequency. Furthermore, we focus on the best way to select the parameters in order to improve the reconstruction quality of ultrasound tomography. Given a fixed sum N iter of N_f1 and N_f2 , simulation results show that the best value of N_f1 is N_iter/2; this choice of parameters offers a normalized error that reduces by 67.6%, compared to the conventional DBIM using a single frequency.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

A simple diagram for data transmission using Manchester code,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2099/,"Trinh, Anh VuPham, Van ThanhTrá»�nh Anh VÅ©","The paper proposes a simple diagram for data transmission on the frequency of 2.4GHz based on the Manchester code. Unlike the classical methods, the receiver usually performs some feedback loops to stabilize the gain to control the sampling at exact position (timing) of the symbol or to synchronize and track frequency. The proposed diagram only uses a cut-off signal to detect data directly without any feedback loops. Although it is simple, the proposed diagram still obtains high stable operation and wide input dynamic range. The experiment was tested by transmitting a 64kbit image file through an embedded FPGA system. Due to the use of Manchester code, then the cost of the proposed method depends only on the bandwidth. Furthermore, the proposed diagram is more suitable for indoor transmission applications and transmitting high-speed data by using Ultra Wide Band (UWB) pulses",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications > Communications

We focus on automotive operating systems conforming to the OSEK/VDX standard. Such operating systems are considered as important components to ensure the reliability of the automotive systems. In previous work, we proposed a framework to verify the design models of reactive systems against their specifications. This framework allows us to check whether the design model conforms to the specification based on a simulation relation. This paper shows a case study in which the framework is applied to a real design of the OSEK/VDX operating system.

To guarantee the safety of them when living on their own, we need to monitor their activities all the time and react to critical situations. The rapid advances in wireless networks, wearable sensors, and communications technologies pave the way for the advent of homecare service systems. Activity recognition is a crucial task in building such systems. This paper investigates two clustering methods, kmeans and Self-organizing map (SOM) for recognizing human daily activities. An experiment is performed on a real data set. The results show that k-means performs pretty well in classifying two activities; however the accuracy is pretty low when the data set is scaled up to five activities. SOM outperforms k-means in most cases of data sets. On average, the resulting accuracy of SOM is 87% and of k-means is 54% for five activities. As a result, SOM is most suitable to be integrated in systems for providing remote homecare services.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2016

Semi-supervised Tensor Regression Model for siRNA Efficacy Prediction,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1468/,"Bui, Ngoc ThangHo, Tu BaoKanda, T.A.Prof. Xuan-Tu Tran","Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can knockdown target genes and thus have an immense impact on biology and pharmacy research. The key question of which siRNAs have high knockdown ability in siRNA research remains challenging as current known results are still far from expectation. This work aims to develop a generic framework to enhance siRNA knockdown efficacy prediction. The key idea is first to enrich siRNA sequences by incorporating them with rules found for designing effective siRNAs and representing them as enriched matrices, then to employ the bilinear tensor regression to predict knockdown efficacy of those matrices. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves better results than existing models in most cases. Our model not only provides a suitable siRNA representation but also can predict siRNA efficacy more accurate and stable than most of state–of–the–art models.

Selecting short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can knockdown target genes efficiently is one of the key tasks in studying RNAi. A number of predictive models have been proposed to predict knockdown efficacy of siRNAs, however, their performance is still far from the expectation. This work aims to develop a predictive model to enhance siRNA knockdown efficacy prediction. The key idea is to combine both the rule -- based and the model -- based approaches. To this end, views of siRNAs that integrate available siRNA design rules are first learned using an adaptive Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm. The learned views and other properties of siRNAs are combined to final representations of siRNAs. The elastic net regression method is employed to learn a predictive model from these final representations.

The proposed focused surface acoustic wave (FSAW) device utilizing aluminum nitride (AlN) single crystal as the piezoelectric substrate is based on the pressure variation due to the continuous droplet ejector. The design, specification, and numerical simulation results are described. Comparisons between the output response of the conventional and concentric structures indicate a more efficient operation of the multiple-segment focused interdigital transducer (FIDT) structure. According to the angular spectrum of the plane wave theory, the amplitude field of FIDTs is calculated through that of straight interdigital transducers. The 3-D integrated model of the FSAW device has a number of advantages, such as the enhancement of the surface displacement amplitudes and an easier fabrication. It is able to detect the breakup appearance of the liquid in the droplet formation process. For the piezoelectric substrate AlN, it is compatible with the CMOS fabrication technology, leading to an inexpensive and reliable system. Moreover, for the proposed FIDTs with multiple straight segments, the acoustic energy is more optimized and focused near the center of the inkjet nozzle. The droplet generation process begins at an output voltage of roughly 0.074 V within 0.25 μs, and the background level of the attenuation of both the mechanical and electrical energy",Article,"Electronics and Communications

For the surface acoustic wave sensors (SAW sensors), the mechanical waves propagating through a piezoelectric crystal include Rayleigh and shear modes. They are influenced by the shape and size of the metal electrodes interdigital transducers (IDTs). Traditionally, IDTs were fabricated in the form of long straight parallel fingers on the piezoelectric substrate. This paper presents a piezoelectric device with focused IDTs (FIDTs) placed on a Y–Z lithium niobate (LiNbO3) substrate to achieve Rayleigh wave energy convergence. The energy conservation principle, called the Rayleigh principle, is used to prove the effective performance of IDTs with concentric shape.

However, as feature sizes and power supply voltages continually decrease, the devices and interconnects have become more vulnerable to transient errors. Transient errors, or soft errors, have severe consequences on chip performance, such as deadlock, data corruption, packet loss and increased packet latency. In this paper, we propose a soft-error resilient 3D-NoC router (SER-3DR) architecture for highly- reliable many-core Systems-on-Chips. The proposed architecture is able to recover from transient errors occurring in different pipeline stages of the SER-3DR. We implemented the architecture in hardware with 45 nm CMOS technology. Evaluation results show that SER-3DR is able to achieve a high level of transient error protection with a latency increase of 18.16%, an additional area cost of 14.98% and a power overhead of 5.90% when compared to the baseline router architecture.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

Among them, 109,914 (2.3%) SNPs and 59,119 (7.1%) short indels were novel. We also detected 30,171 structural variants of which 27,604 (91.5%) were large indels.

Building 3D Event Logs for Video Investigation,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1490/,"Dang, Trung KienWorring, MarcelBui, The DuyProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","In scene investigation, creating a video log captured using a handheld camera is more convenient and more complete than taking photos and notes. By introducing video analysis and computer vision techniques, it is possible to build a spatio-temporal representation of the investigation. Such a representation gives a better overview than a set of photos and makes an investigation more accessible. We develop such methods and present an interface for navigating the result. The processing includes (i) segmenting a log into events using novel structure and motion features making the log easier to access in the time dimension, and (ii) mapping video frames to a 3D model of the scene so the log can be navigated in space. Our results show that, using our proposed features, we can recognize more than 70 percent of all frames correctly, and more importantly find all the events. From there we provide a method to semi-interactively map those events to a 3D model of the scene. With this we can map more than 80 percent of the events.

However, selection of neuron number for hidden layer and definition of suitable centre in order to produce a good regression network are still open problems which have been researched by many people. This article proposes to apply grid equally space nodes as the centre of hidden layer. Then, the authors use k-nearest neighbour method to define the value of regression function at the center and an interpolation RBF network training algorithm with equally spaced nodes to train the network. The experiments show the outstanding efficiency of regression function when the training data has Gauss white noise.",Article,Information Technology (IT),http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/IJORIS.2015100104,Dr Minh Trien Pham,2015

Under sway motion, the centrifugal force results in the radial motion, which in its turn produces the Coriolis force to reduce sway motion. In stochastic analysis and design, the problem is that the Monte Carlo simulation is time-consuming, while the full stochastic linearization totally fails to describe the effectiveness of the spring and damper. We propose the partial linearization applied to the Coriolis damping to overcome the disadvantages of two mentioned methods. Moreover, the proposed technique can give the analytical solution of partial linearized system. A numerical simulation is performed to verify the proposed approach.",Article,"Engineering Mechanics

In order to maximize both precision and recall, our NEN adopts a sequential back-off ensemble approach based on Semantic Supervised Indexing (SSI) - a supervised Word Embedding (WE) method- giving results by inference from training data, and Skip-gram - an unsupervised WE methodtaking advantage of large unlabeled data. In the Chemical-induced diseases relation extraction (CID) model, we firstly resolve co-references by using a multipass sieve to identify cross-sentence references for entities, thus enabling intrasentence relations to be discovered more easily. Following this we extract CID relations using a support vector machine model trained on supervised sentence data from the CDR training and development dataset.

In this work, we first empirically observe that the depth distortion is closely related to the local image characteristics. Based on the observation, we introduce a method to assess the local depth distortion for the edge and non-edge regions. Then, the local distortion is adaptively weighted by the Gabor filter and added up to the quality metric for the depth image.",Article,Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2015

To generate ultrasound, the ultrasonic sensor is excited by the spike. For the Doppler method, the spike excitation was not used previously. It has been used with wideband signal processing methods. In our study, first, the fluid-velocity profile measurement using spike excitation has been carried out for single-phase pipe flow. The received data have been validated by the logarithmic law of the wall, for turbulent flow regime. The flow rate calculated by using the mean velocity profile well coincides with the flow-meter data. Furthermore, the spike signal and the Doppler method are used in the multiwave ultrasonic velocity profile (UVP) method, for the bubbly flow measurement. The experiments show that, if the spike signal is slowly damped, the generated ultrasonic wave is similar to the tone-burst that is required for the Doppler method, but in this case, usually the pulse length is smaller and depends on the damping and sensor characteristics. The autocorrelation technique is used for echo signal processing. The derived UVP systems inherit the advantages from both the spike excitation and Doppler method.",Article,Engineering Mechanics,doi: 10.1016/0250-6874(89)85004-8,Faculty of Engineering Mechanics and Automation (FEMA),2015

Improved time and frequency synchronization in presence of imperfect channel state information,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1761/,"Nguyen, Cong LuongMokraoui, AnissaDuhamel, PierreNguyen, Linh TrungAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","This paper addresses altogether time and frequency synchronization in IEEE 802.11a orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems. The proposed algorithms have two main features: (i) they make use of an additional source of information available at IEEE 802.11a physical layer, on top of the usual ones typically adopted for synchronization such as training sequences. This additional source of information is provided by the higher layers of the communication protocol. In fact, when the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol is activated, the receiver is able to predict some parts of the SIGNAL field that are classically assumed unknown. Moreover, during the negotiation of the transmission medium reservation, the exchanged frames not only help the receiver to predict the SIGNAL field but also to obtain information about the channel state. (ii) Based on this property, we propose a joint MAP time and frequency synchronization algorithm using all available information. Finally, the time synchronization is fine tuned by means of a specific metric in the frequency domain that allows us to minimize the expectation of the transmission error function over all channel estimate errors. Simulation results compliant with the IEEE 802.11a standard in both indoor and outdoor environments show that the proposed algorithm drastically improves the performance in terms of synchronization failure probability and bit error ratio, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Both of the FGM shell as well as the stiffeners are deformed under temperature. The formulations are based on the classical shell theory taking into account geometrical nonlinearity, initial geometrical imperfection, temperature-dependent properties and the Lekhnitsky smeared stiffeners technique with Pasternak type elastic foundation. By applying Galerkin method, the closed-form expression for determining the thermal buckling load is obtained. The numerical results show that the critical thermal load in the case of the uniform temperature rise is smaller than one of the linear temperature distribution through the thickness of the shell, and the critical thermal load increases when increasing the coefficient of stiffeners and vice versa.

To solve this problem. In this paper, we propose channel assignment and energy-efficient routing (CAEER) protocol in multi-hop and multi-channel CRAHNs. The proposed routing scheme suggests an intelligent multi-channel selection function, which is used to assign an appropriate channel for link to build route based on interference avoidance to PUs. Moreover, our routing metrics also consider necessarily the path which reduces energy consumption and control overhead.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose Sector-Chain Based Clustering (SCBC) Routing Protocol, in which, entire network area is divided into sectors (clusters), which balance to the number of nodes. SCBC further reduces energy dissipation of communication in network by constructing chain for each cluster with the chain leader as the cluster head (CH) or secondary cluster head (SCH) that has high residual energy and the shortest distance between candidate nodes and base station (BS) in network. In addition, SCBC improves energy efficiency by calculating the time length of each round in the steady data transmission phase for CHs or SCHs but still guarantee that it is alive in next round. Our simulation results show that the network lifetime of our proposed protocol can be improved about 70% and 20% in comparison with PEGASIS (Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System) and IEEPB (An Improved Energy-Efficient PEGASIS-Based) protocols, respectively.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),IEEE ATC 2015 Conference Proceedings,,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

A New Approach to Predictive Control a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor fed by a Matrix Converter,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2349/,"Nguyen, Ngoc LinhPhD Ngoc Linh Nguyen","In this paper, a new approach to predictive control for speed control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor fed by a matrix converter is presented. The principle of this approach is to extend the possibilities of control by offering additional virtual vectors and to find the vector which minimizes the cost function. This process includes two main steps: first one will determine the location of vector in space vector and the second one will calculate the module of this voltage vector. In detail, a discrete mathematic model of drive system is built to predict the behaviors in the next step under a set of finite control states (FCS). This set will include not only eight real voltage vector from a three-phase two-level matrix converter but also the virtual voltage vectors. Predictive controller optimizes a predefined cost function in order to find a voltage vector giving the best result. Space vector modulation (SVM) technique will be used to generate the found voltage vector. The whole system has been modeled and simulated by using MATLAB and SIMULINK software to verify the performance of proposed method under different load and speed conditions. Results also are compared with classic direct predictive control about fundamental value and total harmonic distortion (THD) to highlight the improvement.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

Vietnamese treebank construction and entropy-based error detection,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1592/,"Nguyen, Phuong ThaiLe, Anh CuongHo, Tu BaoNguyen, Van HiepDr Minh Trien Pham","Treebanks, especially the Penn treebank for natural language processing (NLP) in English, play an essential role in both research into and the application of NLP. However, many languages still lack treebanks and building a treebank can be very complicated and difficult. This work has a twofold objective. Firstly, to share our results in constructing a large Vietnamese treebank (VTB) with three levels of annotation including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. Major steps in the treebank construction process are described with particular regard to specific Vietnamese properties such as lack of word delimiter and isolation. Those properties make sentences highly syntactically ambiguous, and therefore it is difficult to ensure a high level of agreement among annotators. Various studies of Vietnamese syntax were employed not only to define annotations but also to systematically deal with ambiguities. Annotators were supported by automatic labelling tools, which are based on statistical machine learning methods, for sentence pre-processing and a tree editor for supporting manual annotation. As a result, an annotation agreement of around 90 % was achieved. Our second objective is to present our method for automatically finding errors and inconsistencies in treebank corpora and its application to the construction of the VTB. This method employs the Shannon entropy measure in a manner that the more reduced entropy the more corrected errors in a treebank. The method ranks error candidates by using a scoring function based on conditional entropy. Our experiments showed that this method detected high-error-density subsets of original error candidate sets, and that the corpus entropy was significantly reduced after error correction. The size of these subsets was only about one third of the whole set, while these subsets contained 80–90 % of the total errors. This method can also be applied to languages similar to Vietnamese.",Article,Information Technology (IT),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10579-015-9308-5,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2015

We validated our models over diverse geographic provinces i.e., North East, Red River Delta, North Central Coast and South Central Coast in Vietnam. Validation suggested good results for satellite-derived PM2.5 data compared to ground-based PM2.5 (n = 285, r2 = 0.411, RMSE = 20.299 μg m−3 and RE = 39.789%). Further, validation of satellite-derived PM2.5 on two independent datasets for North East and South Central Coast suggested similar results (n = 40, r2 = 0.455, RMSE = 21.512 μg m−3, RE = 45.236% and n = 45, r2 = 0.444, RMSE = 8.551 μg m−3, RE = 46.446% respectively). Also, our satellite-derived PM2.5 maps were able to replicate seasonal and spatial trends of ground-based measurements in four different regions.

By tracking the deviation of the first order diffraction mode from surface-patterned polymers, expansion coefficients in a range 10-7 to 10-4 K-1 can be measured by temperature changes less than 100 oC. A set-up of laser diffraction (SLD) was made, using a He-Ne laser (l = 632.8 nm) and thin film casting technique. The results of measurements on the SLD system for polymers like PVK polycarbonate, PDMS, organic complex (chitosan) and conducting polymer (P3HT) showed that SLD technique can be applied to determine thermal expansion coefficients of different polymeric materials with a considerably small volume. Especially, the fact that a of P3HT-composite films was found to be much lower than that of the pure P3HT suggests a potential application of polymeric composites for organic devices working at elevated temperature, for organic solar cells (OSC) in particular.

Downlink Channel Allocation Scheme deploying Cooperative Channel Monitoring for Cognitive Cellular-Femtocell Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1726/,"Nguyen, Van ToanNguyen, Duc KienNguyen, Nam HoangSripimanwat, KeattisakAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Cognitive cellular-femtocell networks are considered as future mobile communication networks which can satisfy challenging requirements of current mobile communications including high user density, quality of service (QoS) provision and efficient spectrum utilization. In this paper, we present a novel downlink channel allocation scheme which allocates downlink channels to new connection requests of real-time connections in cognitive cellular-femtocell networks. In the scheme, a cognitive femtocell access point (CFAP) cooperates with other 2-hop neighbor CFAPs to establish a cooperative channel monitoring group for monitoring and exchanging information of channel occupancy among the CFAPs belonging to the group. Upon receiving a new connection request from a femtocell user (FU), the serving CFAP uses the information of channel occupancy updated from neighboring CFAPs and interference level of channels to allocate a channel, which is expected to cause the minimum interference to macro users (MUs) of the covering macro base station (MBS). Simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can provide better performance than the conventional downlink channel allocation scheme which does not exploit the cooperation of CFAPs in channel monitoring.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Dynamic analysis of a cracked beam-like bridge subjected to earthquake and moving vehicle,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1791/,"Nguyen, Viet KhoaMs. Cam Le Tran Thi","This paper presents the influence of a crack on the dynamic behavior of a beam-type bridge subjected to separately or simultaneously a moving vehicle and earthquake excitation. In this study, the bridge is modelled as a 3D beam by the finite element method. The stiffness matrix of a cracked beam element with rectangular section adopted from fracture mechanics is presented. The influences of crack appearance time, crack location, crack depth, and vehicle speed on the dynamic response of the bridge are investigated. When a crack is induced during external excitation the stiffness of the structure is changed leading to a change in natural frequencies during vibration. This change in the frequency is analysed by wavelet spectrum, a time-frequency analysis which can examine locally a signal in both time and frequency domains. The relationship between the crack depth and the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the structure is established which may prove useful for assessment of the crack depth. Numerical simulation results are presented to investigate the efficiency of the method.",Article,Engineering Mechanics,,Faculty of Engineering Mechanics and Automation (FEMA),2015

The results showed a failure of elastic bonding mechanism in all compounds and revealed a deficit of valence charge in the unit cells. This valence deficit was not associated with the structural defects and is equally localized in all coordination spheres. As the content of substitution increased, the charge deficit declined systematically from balanced level, signifying the transfer of charge from the B-O6 to A-O12 spheres.

In addition, ROI-based video coding can also help to effectively reduce the number of encoding bitrates required for video transmission over networks, especially for the 3D-TV transmissions. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel ROI-based bit allocation (BA) method which can adaptively extract and increase the visual quality of ROI while saving a huge number of encoding bitrates for video data. In the proposed method, we first detect and extract ROI based on the depth information obtained from 3D-TV video coding sequences. Then, based on the extracted ROI, a novel BA scheme is performed to solve the rate-distortion (R-D) optimization problem, in which the higher priority bitrates are adaptively assigned to ROI while the total encoding bitrates of video frames are kept satisfying all constraints required by the R-D optimization.

X-ray diffraction and Raman-scattering studies reveal the phase separation in crystal structure as changing Co-doping content (x). The samples with x = 0–0.01 are single phase in a tetragonal structure. At higher doping contents (x > 0.01), there is the formation and development of a secondary hexagonal phase. Magnetization measurements at room temperature indicate a coexistence of paramagnetic and weak-ferromagnetic behaviors in BaTi1−xCoxO3 samples with x > 0, while pure BaTiO3 is diamagnetic. Both these properties increase with increasing x. Analyses of X-ray absorption spectra recorded from BaTi1−xCoxO3 for the Co and Ti K-edges indicate the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ ions.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose Sector-Chain Based Clustering (SCBC) Routing Protocol, in which, entire network area is divided into sectors (clusters), which balance to the number of nodes. SCBC further reduces energy dissipation of communication in network by constructing chain for each cluster with the chain leader as the cluster head (CH) or secondary cluster head (SCH) that has high residual energy and the shortest distance between candidate nodes and base station (BS) in network. In addition, SCBC improves energy efficiency by calculating the time length of each round in the steady data transmission phase for CHs or SCHs but still guarantee that it is alive in next round.

Mathematically, NMF can be formulated as a minimization problem with non-negative constraints. This problem attracts much attention from researchers for theoretical reasons and for potential applications. Currently, the most popular approach to solve NMF is the multiplicative update algorithm proposed by Lee and Seung. In this paper, we propose an additive update algorithm that has a faster computational speed than Lee and Seung's multiplicative update algorithm.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Development of a Rainfall-Triggered Landslide System using Wireless Accelerometer Network,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1750/,"Tran, Duc TanNguyen, Dinh ChinhTran, Duc NghiaTa, Duc TuyenAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Recently, Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) based accelerometers become a good candidate for replacing the geophone and inclinometer in landslide monitoring. By integrating different kinds of sensors to each node of a communication system, Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a good facility to measure and remote monitor the environment's parameters. Obviously, the cost of the WSN needs to be reduced in order to set-up the systems in many more wide, unstable slopes. However, for a low-cost solution, there is no Wireless Accelerometer Network (WAN) could provide all information of vibration, inclination, and displacement at once due to essence drawbacks of MEMS based sensors. Therefore, in this paper, we explored the use of low cost, three degrees of freedom (3-DoF) ADXL335 chip based MEMS accelerometers to measure and real-time monitor the inclination, the vibration, and the displacement of the soil slope. Both deterministic and stochastic errors are investigated to maximally reduce the incorrectness from sensors. Several signal processing algorithms are applied to provide the accurate information of the inclination and vibration. For the displacement estimation, a novel procedure is proposed to eliminate the accumulated error.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

The enhancement obtained for the photoelectrical conversion efficiency of the composite based OSCs is attributed to the presence of nanoheterojunctions of TiO2/P3HT. For the temperature range of 30–70°C, the decrease of the open-circuit potential was compensated by an increase of the fill factor; and the increase in the short-circuit current resulted in an overall increase of the energy conversion efficiency. At elevated temperatures of 60–80°C the efficiency of the P3HT- and PTC-based cells reached a maximum value of 1.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Over this temperature range the efficiency of P3HT-based OSC decreased strongly to zero, whereas for the PTC cells it maintained a value as large as 1.2% at the temperature range of 110–140°C. The improved thermal stability of the composite-based device was attributed to the lowered thermal expansion coefficient of the nanocomposite photoactive layer.",Article,Engineering Physics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/463565,Faculty of Engineering Physics and Nanotechnology (FEPN),2015

Most of research work has focused to car driving. However, using motorbike is very popular in some developing countries such as Vietnam, India, etc. Up to now, there are just a few works, which focus to motorbike driving with obvious limitations. Thus, in this research, we proposed a complete solution for bikers who own a smartphone. Our work exploits the information from built-in sensors in Android smartphone. A complete scheme for motorbike driving is proposed. In this scheme, the user state is detected by improving the current Google activity recognition API. If the state is “On vehicle”, the phone automatically switches to silent mode and send to the caller an SMS. Our work provides a mechanism to receive the calls from VIP contacts and urgent calls. The phone would switch back to the normal mode if the state is not ""On vehicle"".

QuocNguyen, Dinh DucChu Duc, TrinhAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","This paper presents a three-electrode capacitive fluidic sensor for detecting an air bubble inside a fluidic channel such as blood vessels, oil or medical liquid channels. The capacitor is designed and fabricated based on a printed circuit board (PCB). The electrodes are fabricated by using copper via structure through top to bottom surface of the PCB. A plastic pipe is layout through the capacitive sensor and perpendicular to the PCB surface. Capacitance of sensor changes when an air bubble inside fluidic flow cross the sensor. The capacitance change can be monitored by using a differential capacitive amplifier, a lock-in amplifier, filter and an NI acquisition card. Signal is processed and calculated on a computer. Air bubble inside the liquid flow are detected by monitor the unbalance signal between the three electrode potential voltages. Output voltage depends on the volume of the air bubble due to dielectric change between capacitor’s electrodes. Output voltage is up to 53 mV when an 2.28 mm3 air bubble crosses the sensing channel. Air bubble velocity can be estimated based on the output pulse signal. This proposed fluidic sensor can be used for void fraction detection in medical devices and systems; fluidic characterization; and water–gas, oil–water and oil–water–gas multiphase flows in petroleum technology.

Data Embedding in Audio Signal by a Novel Bit Marking Method,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1755/,"Vu, Van TamTran, Duc TanNguyen, Dang TienNguyen, Thanh ThuyPhan, Trong HanhAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Embedding data in audio signals is a technique to hide a certain amount of information in the digital audio signal to preserve confidentiality and authenticate information. The bit replacing methods are now mainly used in the techniques of data embedding in the audio signal. Although the capacity of data embedding is large, but embedding error (EE) is high, thus reducing the possibility of transparence of embedded signal. In this paper, we propose a novel method of bit marking (BM) to embed data into the audio signals. To reduce the embedding error and increase signal- to-noise ratio (SNR), we first conducted comparing each segment of data to the bit segments in the audio samples, then find out the bits of audio signals which coincide with embedded data. After that, we use the low- significant bit of audio samples to mark the positions of the bit segments found. The number of marking bits is reduced by the minimization algorithm, and optimization of the parameters of the system. The experiment results show that the quality of the proposed system is better than the least significant bit (LSB) and the embedding large sample (ELS) methods. Therefore, the security of the embedded data is also significantly improved.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

The region of interest is first extracted based on a predefined threshold for histogram regions. A region growing process is then employed to separate multiple human bodies with the same depth interval. Our contribution is the identification of an adaptive growth threshold based on the detected histogram region. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an application in driver distraction detection was introduced. After successfully extracting the driver's position inside the car, we came up with a simple solution to track the driver motion. With the analysis of the difference between initial and current frame, a change of cluster position or depth value in the interested region, which cross the preset threshold, is considered as a distracted activity.

Material properties are assumed to be temperature independent, and graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of constituents. The formulations are based on higher order shear deformation shell theory taking into account geometrical nonlinearity, initial geometrical imperfection and Pasternak type elastic foundation. By applying Galerkin method, explicit relations of load-deflection curves for simply supported curved panels are determined. Effects of material and geometrical properties, in-plane boundary restraint, foundation stiffness and imperfection on the buckling and postbuckling loading capacity of the panels are analyzed and discussed. The novelty of this study results from accounting for higher order transverse shear deformation and panel-foundation interaction in analyzing nonlinear stability of thick functionally graded cylindrical and spherical panels.",Article,"Engineering Mechanics

The obtained single phase of LLTO11 powder was isostatically pressed under a pressure of 450 MPa and annealed at a temperature ranging from 1,100 °C to 1,250 °C. Optimal morphology and grain structure for the ionic conductivity of the samples were achieved at annealing temperature of 1,200 °C. For this ceramic, the lithium ionic grains and grain-boundaries conductivities at room temperature possess a value of 1.5 × 10-3 S/cm and 4.8 × 10-5 S/cm, respectively. The improvement in the grain-boundaries conductivity was explained due to the decrease of the number of grains, included grain boundaries and the diminution of the pores in LLTO samples annealed at 1,200 °C.

In fact, emotions play an extremely important role during the communication between people. And the human face is the most communicative part of the body for expressing emotions; it is recognized that a link exists between facial activity and emotional states. In order to make computer applications more believable and friendly, giving them the ability to recognize and/or express emotions are research fields which have been much focused on. Being able to perform these tasks, firstly, we need to have knowledge about the relationship between emotion and facial activity. Up to now, there have been proposed researches on this relationship. However, almost all these researches focused on analyzing the relationship without taking into account time factors. They analyzed the relationship but did not examined it in the time domain. In this paper, we propose a work on analyzing the relationship between emotions and facial activity in the time domain. Our goal is finding the temporal patterns of facial activity of six basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust).

In addition to traditional training sequences, the SIGNAL field of the physical frame can be considered as a new source of information. Indeed the receiver is able to predict the SIGNAL unknown parts relying on the knowledge provided by the CSMA/CA protocol during the negotiation of the transmission medium reservation. The exchanged RtS control frame used jointly with the bit-rate adaptation algorithm to the channel helps the receiver not only to predict the SIGNAL field but also to get information on the channel state. Based on this knowledge, joint MAP channel, time and frequency synchronization algorithm is carried out. Moreover to estimate the residual time offset, a timing metric in frequency domain is performed by minimizing the average of transmission errors in the presence of all channel estimation errors. The performance in terms of probability of synchronization failure is shown to be improved compared to existing algorithms.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Global-local Approach to the Design of Dynamic Vibration Absorber for Damped Structures,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1244/,"Nguyen, Dong AnhNguyen, Xuan NguyenNguyen, Hoang QuanMs. Cam Le Tran Thi","The dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) has attracted attention since its invention. This paper deals with the optimization problems of the standard DVA and two other models of DVA called three-element DVA and non-traditional DVA for damped primary structures. Unlike the standard configuration, the three-element DVA contains two spring elements in which one is connected to a dashpot in a series and the other is placed in parallel. Meanwhile the non-traditional DVA has a linear viscous damper connecting the absorber mass directly to the ground. There have been some studies on the design of three-element and non-traditional dynamic vibration absorbers in the case of undamped primary structures. These studies have shown that both three-element and non-traditional DVAs perform better than the standard DVA. When the primary structure is damped, there are very few studies on the three-element and non-traditional DVAs in the literature. This article proposes a global-local approach to give approximate analytical solutions of the H1 optimization for all standard, three-element and non-traditional DVAs attached to damped primary structures. The main idea of the study is based on the global-local criterion of the equivalent linearization method in order to replace approximately the original damped structure by an equivalent undamped one. Afterwards, the already derived expressions of the optimal parameters for the undamped primary system case are used with the equivalent undamped structure that was just obtained. The numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results. Additionally, design aids, which show the variation of the optimal design quantities for various DVA mass ratios and inherent structural damping ratios are also provided.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

The original equation is averaged by the stochastic averaging method at first. Then the resulting nonlinear averaged equations are linearized by the equivalent linearization method so that the equations obtained can be solved exactly by the technique of auxiliary function. The mean square response of the Van der Pol oscillator is computed algebraically and compared to the ones obtained by numerical simulation and by technique combining methods of stochastic averaging and equivalent non-linearization. The results show that the proposed technique gives a good prediction on mean square responses of the Van der Pol oscillator. In addition, the proposed technique can be applied to other nonlinear systems for it does not require any special conditions, and it can be improved by advanced optimization criteria of the equivalent linearization method.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

D-AVTree: DHT-based Search System to Support Scalable Multi-attribute Queries,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1486/,"Nguyen, Hoai SonTan, YasuoShinoda, YoichiProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","At present, vast numbers of information resources are available on the Internet. However, one emerging issue is how to search and exploit these information resources in an efficient and flexible manner with high scalability. In this study, we focused our attention on the design of a distributed hash table (DHT)-based search system that supports efficient scalable multi-attribute queries of information resources in a distributed manner. Our proposed system, named D-AVTree, is built on top of a ring-based DHT, which partitions a one-dimensional key space across nodes in the system. It utilizes a descriptive naming scheme, which names each resource using an attribute-value (AV) tree, and the resource names are mapped to d-bit keys in order to distribute the resource information to responsible nodes based on a DHT routing algorithm. Our mapping scheme maps each AV branch of a resource name to a d-bit key where AV branches that share a subsequence of AV pairs are mapped to a continuous portion of the key space. Therefore, our mapping scheme ensures that the number of resources distributed to a node is small and it facilitates efficient multi-attribute queries by querying only a small number of nodes. Further, the scheme has good compatibility with key-based load balancing algorithms for DHT-based networks. Our system can achieve both efficiency and a good degree of load balancing even when the distribution of AV pairs in the resource names is skewed. Our simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of our solution in terms of the distribution cost, query hit ratio, and the degree of load balancing compared with conventional approaches.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2014

Hybrid Organic Solar Cells (HOSC) were then prepared by using a nano hybrid material of P3HT:PCBM/nc-TiO2. The HOSC have the laminar structure of Al/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2/Ti, where P3HT:PCBM were made by spincoating. Under illumination of the standard light wavelength ( = 470 nm), the polymer luminescence quenching was observed at the heterojunctions, resulting in the charge separation. With an illumination power of 56 mW/cm2, a best hybrid solar cell exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.60 V, short cut current density of 4.60 mA/cm2, fill factor of 0.54 and photoelectrical conversion efficiency of 2.6 %. This suggests a useful application for fabricating “reverse” OSCs, where the illumination light goes-in through the windows of Al-electrode cathode, instead of the indium tin oxide (ITO). For these devices, the Ohmic contact of wires to metallic Ti-substrates can be made much better than to ITO electrode.

For its efficiency, the H.264 is expected to encode real-time and/or high-definition video. However, the H.264 standard also requires highly complex and long lasting computation. To overcome these difficulties, many efforts have been deployed to increase encoding speed. Besides, with the revolution of portable devices, multimedia chips for mobile environments are more and more developed. Thus, power-oriented design for H.264 video encoders is currently a tremendous challenge. This paper discusses these trends and presents an overview of the state of the art on power features for different H.264 hardware encoding architectures. We also propose the VENGME's design, a particular hardware architecture of H.264 encoder that enables applying low-power techniques and developing power-aware ability. This low power encoder is a four-stage architecture with memory access reduction, in which, each module has been optimized.

This paper proposes a new implementation of dynamic frequency scaling to manage the power consumption based on the occupancy level of a FIFO in a communication link between two components. Based on control theory, the method is simple and application independent. The PI controller proposed here was first tested in the MATLAB environment and then designed using VHDL. Simulations in the MATLAB environment and in ModelSim have allowed the validation of the control technique proposed. Being synthesized in technology FD-SOI 28nm using RC synthesis tool from Cadence, the control method presents only 10.8% of Silicon area overhead with 1.6% of power consumption reduction.

Reducing Temporal Redundancy in MJPEG using Zipfian Estimation Techniques,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/426/,"Nguyen, Ngoc SinhBui, Duy HieuTran, Xuan TuProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","The bit-rate is the one the most crucial factor in storing and transmitting the digital videos while the complexity plays the most important part in embedded systems.Nowadays, H.264/AVC and newest video advance codec are great in reducing bit-rate. However, these codec have high processing dependencies and complexity. This leads to difficulties in implementing them into the embedded systems, maintaining the real time properties of the system and power consumption problems. Therefore, MJPEG standard is still widely used in the embedded systems even it is inefficient in reducing the bit-rate. In this paper, we improve the quality and the bitrate of the MJPEG codec with low-complexity techniques: temporal compression and encoding residual values in motions. Motion JPEG simply compresses each frame in a video sequence using JPEG still image compression standard. This video codec satisfies power consumption and real-time properties of embedded systems while having very low complexity. However, the downside is its inefficiency in reducing the bit-rate because there are still redundancies between encoded frames. In this paper, we focus on reducing temporal redundancies in MJPEG using a motion detection algorithm, called Zipfian estimation. The Zipfian estimation helps MJPEG extract separately the moving blocks and the stationary blocks then removes temporal redundancies by minimizing encoded bit-stream of stationary blocks and encoding only the residuals of the moving blocks between adjacent frames. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide twice compression ratio as much as the conventional MJPEG, and an approximate quality and bit-rate as the H.264/AVC (Intra-mode). Even the proposed method uses the Zipfian estimation, it still has smaller number of operations than the conventional MJPEG if the percentage of the static scene is equal or greater than 60%. Compared with the H.264/AVC Intra mode when turning off the rate-distortion optimization, the running time of the proposed method is still only a half.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Outstanding Student Paper Award & Travel Support Grant Award,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/426/1/apccas-paper.pdf,"Electronics and Communications

A ray scanning method is used for modeling the propagation directions (lines) along each of which the MLEF is used for estimating the CSM parameters.The object 2D image is then reconstructed by transforming these estimated CSM parameters from the polar coordinates to Carte sian coordinates. it is not necessary to increase the ensemble size (which means an increase in the algorithm complexity) when the noise level is low.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

The strategy are conducted in two phases: self-displacement shifting the robotic swarm from room to room, and self-dispersion and aggregation for exploration and coverage in each room. A decentralised control is built up by decentralised node control governing the dispersion and aggregation and decentralised connectivity control guaranteeing the global network preservation. The self-deployment strategy reduces significantly number of the robots while increasing its capacity of exploration and coverage.

Monitoring the Oscillation Frequency Drift of an Optoelectronic Oscillator with a Vector Network Analyzer,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1379/,"Pham, Toan ThangBach, Gia-DuongVu, Van YemLedoux-Rak, IJournet, BernardMs. Cam Le Tran Thi","The classical structure of an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is based on a long optical fiber loop creating a delay line with very low insertion loss. The oscillation frequency is proportional to the reciprocal of the propagation delay which depends on temperature by the way of the effective refractive index of the fiber. In case of a long fiber loop, even a small change of the temperature can induce an oscillation frequency drift. In this paper, a system based on a vector network analyzer (VNA) is proposed to monitor the oscillation frequency drift with a minimum of extra optical components. There is a good correlation between the phase evolution determined by the VNA and the OEO frequency drift. Knowing the drift it is possible to correct results obtained from the OEO used as an optical path measurement tool for either distance or refractive index variation detection.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

APham, Duc ThangYu, S.C.Ms. Cam Le Tran Thi","We prepared BaTi1-xMnxO3 samples (x = 0 and 0.05) by standard solid-state reaction at 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C in an Ar ambient to change oxidation number of Mn dopants. The fabricated samples were then studied structural characterization and electronic structures by means of X-ray diffraction and absorption, and Raman scattering and electron-spin-resonance spectrometers. We found oxidation numbers 2+ and 3+ of Mn ions coexisting in BaTi1-xMnxO3 with x = 0.05, where the Mn2+/Mn3+ ratio is about one for the sample annealed at 700 degrees C. These Mn ions prefer locating at the Ti site in the tetragonal BaTiO3 host lattice. In particular, there is a change in the oxidation number of Mn2+ -> Mn3+ when the annealing temperature changes from 700 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Their magnetic properties are accordingly changed. Meanwhile, annealing pure BaTiO3 in an Ar ambient at 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C does not lead to ferromagnetic (FM) order; they are almost diamagnetic. With the obtained results, we believe that FM order in Mn-doped BaTiO3 annealed in an Ar ambient is associated with exchange interactions of Mn2+ ions mediated by oxygen vacancies rather than associated with Mn3+ ions.

PhucPham, Duc ThangYu, S.C.Ms. Cam Le Tran Thi","The magnetic properties of polycrystalline ceramic samples (Nd1-xYx)0.7Sr0.3MnO3 with x = 0.21 - 0.35 were studied by means of dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements. Experimental results reveal a strong decrease of the ferromagnetic (FM)-paramagnetic phase-transition temperature (TC) from 97 to 65 K as increasing x from 0.21 to 0.35, respectively. There is magnetic inhomogeneity associated with short-range FM order. Particularly, the samples undergo a spin-glass (SG) phase transition at the so-called blocking temperature (TB) below TC, which shifts toward lower temperatures with increasing the applied field, Hex; TB → Tg (the SG phase-transition temperature) as Hex → 0. The existence of the SG behavior in these samples was also confirmed by frequency (f) dependences of the ac susceptibility. For the in-phase/real component, χ'(T), it shows a frequency-dependent peak at the SG freezing temperature (Tf); Tf → Tg as f → 0. Dynamics of this process were analyzed by means of the slowing down scaling law, τ/τ0 ∝ (Tf /Tg - 1)-zv, where τ0 and zv are the characteristic time and critical exponent, respectively. Fitting the experimental Tf (f) data to the scaling law gave the results of zv = 10.1-12.3 and τ0 = 10-21-10-15s. These values are different from those expected for canonical SG systems with zv = 10 and τ0 = 10-13s, revealing the cluster-SG behavior of (Nd1-xYx)0.7Sr0.3MnO3 samples. Notably, the increase in Y content leads to the shift of τ0 and zv values toward those of canonical SG systems, which is ascribed to an expansi- n of SG clusters.",Article,"Engineering Physics

The results reveal the samples exhibiting the crossover of first-order and second-order phase transitions, where the exponent values β = 0.271 and γ = 0.922 for x = 0, and β = 0.234–0.236 and γ = 1.044–1.063 for x = 0.07 determined by using modified Arrott plots and static-scaling hypothesis are close to those expected for the tricritical mean-field theory (β = 0.25 and γ = 1.0). Particularly, the TC of x = 0 and 0.07 can be any value in the temperature ranges of 240–255 K and 170–278 K, respectively, depending on the magnitude of applied magnetic field and determination techniques. Around the TC, studying the MC effect of the samples has revealed a large magnetic-entropy change (ΔSm) up to ∼8 J/kg K for the applied field interval ΔH = 50 kOe, corresponding to refrigerant capacity values of 200–245 J/kg. These phenomena are related to the crossover nature and the persisting of FM/anti-FM interactions even above the TC, as further confirmed by electron-spin-resonance data, Curie–Weiss law-based analyses, and an exponential parameter characteristic of magnetic order n = dLn|ΔSm|/dLnH.",Article,"Engineering Physics

LPhung, Quoc ThanhHoang, Nam-NhatDuong, Anh TuanYu, S. CMs. Cam Le Tran Thi","This paper presents a detailed study on the Co-doping influence on the electrical and magnetotransport properties of La0.7Ca0.3Mn1-xCoxO3(x = 0.09-0.17) prepared by solid-state reaction. Magnetic measurements versus temperature revealed a gradual decrease of the magnetization (M) and Curie temperature (T-C) with increasing Co concentration (x). The T-C values vary from 194 to 159 K as changing x from 0.09 to 0.17, respectively. H/M versus M-2 performances around T-C prove the x = 0.09 sample undergoing a first-order magnetic phase transition (FOMT) while the samples with x >= 0.11 undergo a second-order magnetic phase transition (SOMT). The other with x = 0.10 is considered as a threshold concentration of the FOMT-SOMT transformation. Considering temperature dependences of resistivity, rho(T), in the presence and absence of the magnetic field, the samples (excepting for x = 0.17) exhibit a metal-insulator transition at T (P) = 60-160 K, which shifts toward lower temperatures with increasing x. In the metallic-ferromagnetic region, the rho(T) data are well fitted to a power function rho(T) = rho(0) + rho(2) T-2 + rho(4.5) T-4.5. This indicates electron-electron and electron-magnon scattering processes are dominant at temperatures T < T (P). In addition, the conduction data at temperatures T > theta(D)/2 (theta(D) is the Debye temperature) and T (P) < T < theta(D)/2 obey the small-polaron and variable-range hopping models, respectively. The values of activation energy E-p, and density of states at the Fermi level N(E-F) were accordingly determined. Here, N(E-F) increases while E-p decreases when an external magnetic field is applied. We also have found that N(E-F) increases when materials transfer from the FOMT to the SOMT, and N(E-F) value becomes smallest for the sample having the coexistence of the FOMT and SOMT (i.e., x = 0.10).",Article,Engineering Physics,doi: 10.1109/TMAG.2014.2301713,Faculty of Engineering Physics and Nanotechnology (FEPN),2014

However, most of basic and recent studies about UT have a high computational complexity because they have to solve large iterative forward and inverse problems. Among different techniques proposed for UT, Born Iterative Method (BIM) and Distort Born Iterative Method (DBIM) based on Born approximation have been introduced as efficient diffraction tomography approaches. DBIM can offer a faster convergence whereas BIM is less affected by noise. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient scheme of BIM-interpolation-DBIM in order to reduce the computational complexity and to improve the image reconstruction. The combination of BIM and DBIM takes advantage of both methods while the interpolation process in the middle stage help speed up the convergence. Simulation scenarios whose parameters are inspired from a previous experiment have been performed in order to show the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),acoustic tomography;biomedical ultrasonics;computational complexity;image reconstruction;interpolation;iterative methods;medical image processing;BIM-interpolation process;DBIM;born iterative method;enhanced image reconstruction;improved distorted BIM;reduced computational complexity;ultrasound tomography;Image reconstruction;Interpolation;Iterative methods;Tomography;Ultrasonic imaging;Vectors;Born iterative method (BIM);Ultrasound tomography;distorted Born iterative method (DBIM);interpolation;inverse scattering,,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Antenna without Phase Center for DOA Estimation in Compressive Array Processing,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1722/,"Tran, Thi Thuy QuynhTran, Duc TanNguyen, Linh TrungPhan, AnhAssoc/Prof Duc Tan Tran","Recently, Compressive Sensing (CS) has been applied to array signal processing. In theory, Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation based on CS recovery can work well in correlated environments. However, a large number of sensors (i.e., linear measurements) are still needed for CS recovery. To improve on this, we propose a new CS-based DOA estimation method with a recently designed antenna structure called the Asymmetric Antenna without Phase Center (Asym-AWPC). The best reconstruction is achieved by solving the l1-norm optimization problem, which is cast as an l1-regularized least-squares program. Simulated results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed CS-based Asym-AWPC DOA estimator in a multipath environment over a recent Asym-AWPC DOA estimator but using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) rather than CS. Further improvement on the resolution can be achieved by tuning the degree of asymmetry in designing the Asym-AWPC.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

The capacitor is designed and fabricated based on a printed circuit board (PCB). The electrodes are fabricated by using copper via structure through top to bottom surface of the PCB. A plastic pipe is layout through the capacitive sensor and perpendicular to the PCB surface. Capacitance of sensor changes when an air bubble inside fluidic flow cross the sensor. The capacitance change can be monitored by using a differential capacitive amplifier, a lock-in amplifier, filter and an NI acquisition card. Signal is processed and calculated on a computer. Air bubble inside the liquid flow are detected by monitor the unbalance signal between the three electrode potential voltages. Output voltage depends on the volume of the air bubble due to dielectric change between capacitor’s electrodes. Output voltage is up to 53 mV when an 2.28 mm3 air bubble crosses the sensing channel. Air bubble velocity can be estimated based on the output pulse signal. This proposed fluidic sensor can be used for void fraction detection in medical devices and systems; fluidic characterization; and water–gas, oil–water and oil–water–gas multiphase flows in petroleum technology.

One method to protect the sensitive data is using symmetric-key block cypher before and after sending it over the network using same secret key. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is currently considered as best symmetric-key block cipher. With the block size of 128-bits and the key length starting from 128-bit up to 256-bits, AES has been proved to takes years to break. However, AES implementations in software also require more computations and time to encrypt and decrypt the data. This bottleneck not only reduces the overall system throughput but also increases the power consumption especially in the embedded system, where there are limited computations and resources. To improve the throughput and reduce the power consumption of the AES crypto system, in this work, we proposed a combined, low-cost and high-throughput AES encryption and decryption architecture supporting all key-lengths as specified in the FIPS197.

Therefore, scalability analysis becomes very important in software verification and validation. However, current approaches to empirical scalability analysis remain limitations related to the number of supported models and performance. In this paper, we propose a runtime approach for estimating the program resource usage with two aims: evaluating the program scalability and revealing potential errors. In this approach, the resource usage of a program is first observed when it is executed on inputs with different scales, the observed results are then fitted on a model of the usage according to the program's input. Comparing to other approaches, ours supports diverse models to illustrate the resource usage, i.e., linear-log, power-law, polynomial, etc. We currently focus on the computation cost and stack frames usage as two representatives of resource usage, but the approach can be extended to other kinds of resource. The experimental result shows that our approach achieves more precise estimation and better performance than other state-of-the-art approaches.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2542091&dl=ACM&coll=DL,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2013

The working principles of this proposed SAW device are velocity decay, delay time as well as insertion losses reported in cases of linear and exponential motion. It utilizes CMOS compatible materials, AlN film on Si substrate, being suitable for inexpensive and reliable systems. AlN thin film layer is deposited on the top of silicon substrate. The microfluidic channel is etched through wafer and perpendicular to the SAW propagation path between the transmitter IDT and receiver IDT. Electrical and mechanical characteristic analysis is performed to accurately determine the relation between flow motion and output signal. Velocity decay constant decreases and achieves the saturated state from -1 dB to -4.5 dB after 60 mm/s for the linear motion. Otherwise, velocity decay constant is inversely proportional to the exponential order of velocity due to the leaky acoustic wave in the microfluidic channel.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

A rather large exchange bias field shift up to 1 Hex/ Hex = 500% was obtained. This change governs mainly the electric-field strength rather than the applied current. It is explained as being realized through the competition between the electric-field induced uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropies.

Improvement for Rate-Based Protocols in Multihop Wireless Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2281/,"Duong, Le MinhZitoune, L.Veque, VeroniqueDương Lê Minh","Transport layer performance in IEEE 802.11 multihop wireless networks (MHWNs) has been greatly challenged by wireless medium characteristics and multihop nature which induce several types of packet loss including collision, random channel errors and route failures. In this paper, we propose a novel rate control scheme, called Bi-Metric Rate Control (BMRC), which regulates efficiently the source rate in MHWNs. BMRC’s design is based on two MAC metrics: the Medium Access Delay used to detect the network contention level, and the Average Transmission Time used to estimate the effective packet sending rate by which the network will not be overloaded. The simulation results show that the adapted mechanism introduces significant performance improvement in terms of fairness, packet loss rate and delay in MHWNs.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),protocols;telecommunication control;telecommunication standards;wireless LAN;BMRC;IEEE 802.11;MHWN;average transmission time;bimetric rate control;effective packet sending rate estimation;medium access delay;multihop wireless networks;network contention level;packet loss rate;random channel errors;rate-based protocols;route failures;transport layer performance;Delays;Network topology;Packet loss;Throughput;Topology,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2281/1/vtc2013.pdf,Information Technology (IT),2013

Furthermore, modification of proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to a rectangular spanwise coherence matrix in order to investigate the spanwise correlation and coherence of the unsteady pressure fields. The unsteady pressure fields have been directly measured in wind tunnel tests on some typical prisms with slenderness ratios B/D=1, B/D=1 with a splitter plate in the wake, and B/D=5. Significance and contribution of the first covariance mode associated with the first principal coordinates as well as those of the first spectral eigenvalue and associated spectral mode are clarified by synthesis of the unsteady pressure fields and identification of intrinsic events inside the unsteady pressure fields.

This article proposes a novel method for image annotation based on combining feature-word distributions, which map from visual space to word space, and word-topic distributions, which form a structure to capture label relationships for annotation. We refer to this type of model as Feature-Word-Topic models. The introduction of topics allows us to efficiently take word associations, such as {ocean, fish, coral} or {desert, sand, cactus}, into account for image annotation. Unlike previous topic-based methods, we do not consider topics as joint distributions of words and visual features, but as distributions of words only. Feature-word distributions are utilized to define weights in computation of topic distributions for annotation. By doing so, topic models in text mining can be applied directly in our method. Our Feature-word-topic model, which exploits Gaussian Mixtures for feature-word distributions, and probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) for word-topic distributions, shows that our method is able to obtain promising results in image annotation and retrieval.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

The main features of this system are (1) to extract dominant ingredients and tastes in a region by analyzing the ingredients' frequency and its uniqueness, and (2) to transform user's existing materials or original recipe to a new recipe according to a targeted taste. To examine the feasibility and applicability of the algorithm, we have developed a web-based application with a recipe database collected from approximately 200 recipes in over 7 regions of Japan: Hokkaido-Tohoku, Kanto, Kansai, Shikoku, Tyubu, Kyusyu-Okinawa and Tyugoku.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2013

Chaotic Compressed Sensing and its Application in Magnetic Resonance Imaging,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1358/,"Nguyen, Linh TrungTruong, Minh ChinhTran, Duc TanLe, Vu HaDo, Ngoc MinhLê Vũ Hà","Fast image acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important, due to the need to find ways that help relieve patient’s stress during MRI scans. Methods for fast MRI have been proposed, most notably among them are pMRI (parallel MRI), SWIFT (SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation), and compressed sensing (CS) based MRI. Although it promises to significantly reduce acquisition time, applying CS to MRI leads to difficulties with hardware design because of the randomness nature of the measurement matrix used by the conventional CS methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines the above-mentioned three approaches for fast MRI by designing a compound measurement matrix from a series of single measurement matrices corresponding to pMRI, SWIFT, and CS. In our method, the CS measurement matrix is designed to be deterministic via chaotic systems. This chaotic compressed sensing (CCS) measurement matrix, while retaining most features of the random CS matrix, is simpler to realize in hardware. Several compound measurement matrices have been constructed and examined in this work, including CCS-MRI, CCS-pMRI, CCS-SWIFT, and CCS-pSWIFT. Simulation results showed that the proposed method allows an increase in the speed of the MRI acquisition process while not compromising the quality of the acquired MR images.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Power Save Protocol Using Chain Based Routing,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2374/,"Nguyen, Thanh TungNguyen, Van DucNguyen, Hai ThanhPhan, Cong VinhNguyen, Dai ThoDr. Dai Tho Nguyen","Sensor networks are deployed in numerous military and civil applications, such as remote target detection, weather monitoring, weather forecast, natural resource exploration and disaster management. Despite having many potential applications, wireless sensor networks still face a number of challenges due to their particular characteristics that other wireless networks, like cellular networks or mobile ad hoc networks do not have. The most difficult challenge of the design of wireless sensor networks is the limited energy resource of the battery of the sensors. This limited resource restricts the operational time that wireless sensor networks can function in their applications. Routing protocols play a major part in the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks because data communication dissipates most of the energy resource of the networks. In many situations, a base station only needs a summary of the gathered information. For example, the base station might only require the maximum temperature of all sub-regions, each covered by a sensor or the average temperature of all sensors in the network. For similar types of application, data aggregation can be applied at all sensor nodes before the data is forwarded to the base station. The above discussions imply a new family of protocols called chain-based protocols. In the protocols, all sensor nodes sense and gather data in an energy efficient manner by cooperating with their closest neighbors. The gathering process can be done until an elected node calculates the final data and sends the data to the base station.",Book Section,"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Support Measures to Estimate the Reliability of Evolutionary Events Predicted by Reconciliation Methods,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1861/,"Nguyen, Thi HauBerry, VincentRanwez, VincentScornavacca, CelineNguyá»�n Th","The genome content of extant species is derived from that of ancestral genomes, distorted by evolutionary events such as gene duplications, transfers and losses. Reconciliation methods aim at recovering such events and at localizing them in the species history, by comparing gene family trees to species trees. These methods play an important role in studying genome evolution as well as in inferring orthology relationships. A major issue with reconciliation methods is that the reliability of predicted evolutionary events may be questioned for various reasons: Firstly, there may be multiple equally optimal reconciliations for a given species tree–gene tree pair. Secondly, reconciliation methods can be misled by inaccurate gene or species trees. Thirdly, predicted events may fluctuate with method parameters such as the cost or rate of elementary events. For all of these reasons, confidence values for predicted evolutionary events are sorely needed. It was recently suggested that the frequency of each event in the set of all optimal reconciliations could be used as a support measure. We put this proposition to the test here and also consider a variant where the support measure is obtained by additionally accounting for suboptimal reconciliations. Experiments on simulated data show the relevance of event supports computed by both methods, while resorting to suboptimal sampling was shown to be more effective. Unfortunately, we also show that, unlike the majority-rule consensus tree for phylogenies, there is no guarantee that a single reconciliation can contain all events having above 50% support. In this paper, we detail how to rely on the reconciliation graph to efficiently identify the median reconciliation. Such median reconciliation can be found in polynomial time within the potentially exponential set of most parsimonious reconciliations.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Reconciliation and local gene tree rearrangement can be of mutual profit,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1859/,"Nguyen, Thi HauRanwez, VincentPointet, StéphanieChifolleau, Anne-MurielDoyon, Jean-PhilippeBerry, VincentNguyá»�n Th","Reconciliation methods compare gene trees and species trees to recover evolutionary events such as duplications, transfers and losses explaining the history and composition of genomes. It is well-known that gene trees inferred from molecular sequences can be partly erroneous due to incorrect sequence alignments as well as phylogenetic reconstruction artifacts such as long branch attraction. In practice, this leads reconciliation methods to overestimate the number of evolutionary events. Several methods have been proposed to circumvent this problem, by collapsing the unsupported edges and then resolving the obtained multifurcating nodes, or by directly rearranging the binary gene trees. Yet these methods have been defined for models of evolution accounting only for duplications and losses, i.e. can not be applied to handle prokaryotic gene families. Results We propose a reconciliation method accounting for gene duplications, losses and horizontal transfers, that specifically takes into account the uncertainties in gene trees by rearranging their weakly supported edges. Rearrangements are performed on edges having a low confidence value, and are accepted whenever they improve the reconciliation cost. We prove useful properties on the dynamic programming matrix used to compute reconciliations, which allows to speed-up the tree space exploration when rearrangements are generated by Nearest Neighbor Interchanges (NNI) edit operations. Experiments on synthetic data show that gene trees modified by such NNI rearrangements are closer to the correct simulated trees and lead to better event predictions on average. Experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed method leads to a decrease in the reconciliation cost and the number of inferred events. Finally on a dataset of 30 k gene families, this reconciliation method shows a ranking of prokaryotic phyla by transfer rates identical to that proposed by a different approach dedicated to transfer detection [BMCBIOINF 11:324, 2010, PNAS 109(13):4962–4967, 2012]. Conclusions Prokaryotic gene trees can now be reconciled with their species phylogeny while accounting for the uncertainty of the gene tree. More accurate and more precise reconciliations are obtained with respect to previous parsimony algorithms not accounting for such uncertainties [LNCS 6398:93–108, 2010, BIOINF 28(12): i283–i291, 2012].

These points are associated with the known corresponding point pairs to select a suitable landmark point set for using Local Thin Plate Spline deformation model over 9 partial areas of fingerprint images in order to find new corresponding minutiae pairs. This procedure is repeated until no more new corresponding minutiae pairs are distinguished or the number of corresponding point pairs is large enough.

In this paper, we present a simple approach for controlling the outputWGMs of erbium-doped silica microsphere lasers. With the presented scheme, accurate adjustment of the coupling gap between the collection fiber taper and the spherical surface allows us to select different single modes of the microsphere laser or different multimode configurations (also functions of the waist diameter of taper and the Er-doped concentration). The nonlinear frequency shift of the microsphere cavity as a function of intracavity power has also been studied. The high intensity and high sidemode suppression ratio of the obtained singleWGMare suitable for spectroscopy, optical sensors, and communications. © 2013 Optical Society of America",Article,ISI-indexed journals,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2098/1/josab-30-6-1586.pdf,Bùi Trung Ninh,2013
Interface Charge Trap Density of Solution Processed Ferroelectric Gate Thin Film Transistor Using ITO/PZT/Pt Structure,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2621/,"Pham, Van ThanhBui, Nguyen Quoc TrinhTakaaki, MiyasakoPhan, Trong TueEisuke, TokumitsuTatsuya, ShimodaDr. Bui Nguyen Quoc Trinh","The conductance method was applied to investigate the interface charge trap density (Dit) of solution processed ferroelectric gate thin film transistor (FGT) using indium-tin oxide (ITO)/ Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT)/Pt structure. As a result, a large value of Dit of MFS capacitor, i.e., Pt/PZT/ITO, was estimated to be 1.2 × 1014 eV−1 cm−2. This large Dit means that an interface between the ITO layer and the PZT layer is imperfect and it is one of themain reasons for the poor memory property of this FGT. By using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), this imperfect interface was clearly observed. Thus, it is concluded that improvement of this interface is critical for better memory performance.",Article,"Engineering Physics

The filter operates through two phases: the time update and the data correction. The time update predicts the robot position by reformulating the kinematics model to be non-memoryless. The correction step corrects the prediction by extrapolating the delayed measurement to the present and then incorporating it to the being estimate as there is no delay. The optimality of the incorporation is ensured by the derivation of a multiplier that reflects the relevance of past observations to the present.

With the new prediction techniques, intra prediction in H.264 improves the bit rate but it also increases the memory bandwidth and the computational complexity with many prediction modes. In this work, the intra prediction procedure is fully analyzed. Based on the analysis, a hardware architecture for intra prediction focused on main profile of H.264/AVC is proposed.

This paper proposes a method for generating accurate models of components in order to solve this issue in the context of the component-based systems. The key idea of this method is to generate minimal deterministic finite automata as the accurate models of the corresponding components. For this purpose, the proposed method first computes a set of traces as a regular language of a given component by executing all possible experiments over the alphabet of the component. This method then constructs a regular expression to represent this set. After that, a minimal deterministic finite automaton as an accurate model of the component is generated by applying the Thompson algorithm and some optimized activities. The generated models are useful for the existing model-based approaches, e.g., model checking and model-based testing in improving quality of component-based software.

The multimedia computing technology has also been creating new information provision environments in the world-wide scope. Innovative integrations of large scale multimedia data management and computing technology will lead to a new information society. In the design of multimedia systems, one of the most important issues is how to search and analyze media data (images, music, movies and documents), according to impressions and contexts. We have proposed and introduced a ""Kansei"" and semantic associative search method based on our “Mathematical Model of Meaning (MMM) [11], [13], [14]”. The concept of ""Kansei"" includes several meanings on sensitive recognition, such as ""impression"", ""human senses"", ""feelings"", ""sensitivity"", ""psychological reaction"" and ""physiological reaction"". This model realizes ""Kansei"" processing and semantic associative search for media data, according to user’s impressions and contexts. This model is applied to compute semantic correlations between keywords, images, music and documents dynamically in a context-dependent way. The main feature of this model is to realize semantic associative search in the 2000 dimensional orthogonal semantic space with semantic projection functions. This space is created for dynamically computing semantic equivalence or similarity between keywords and media data. We have constructed ""Cross-Cultural Multimedia Computing Systems” for sharing and analyzing different cultures with semantic associative functions applied to “cultural & multimedia data,” as a new platform of cross-cultural collaborative environments.

Modeling Protein Evolution with Several Amino Acid Replacement Matrices Depending on Site Rates,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/69/,"Le, Si QuangDang, Cao CuongGascuel, OlivierCao Cuong Dang","Most protein substitution models use a single amino acid replacement matrix summarizing the biochemical properties of amino acids. However, site evolution is highly heterogeneous and depends on many factors that influence the substitution patterns. In this paper, we investigate the use of different substitution matrices for different site evolutionary rates. Indeed, the variability of evolutionary rates corresponds to one of the most apparent heterogeneity factors among sites, and there is no reason to assume that the substitution patterns remain identical regardless of the evolutionary rate. We first introduce LG4M, which is composed of four matrices, each corresponding to one discrete gamma rate category (of four). These matrices differ in their amino acid equilibrium distributions and in their exchangeabilities, contrary to the standard gamma model where only the global rate differs from one category to another. Next, we present LG4X, which also uses four different matrices, but leaves aside the gamma distribution and follows a distribution-free scheme for the site rates. All these matrices are estimated from a very large alignment database, and our two models are tested using a large sample of independent alignments. Detailed analysis of resulting matrices and models shows the complexity of amino acid substitutions and the advantage of flexible models such as LG4M and LG4X. Both significantly outperform single-matrix models, providing gains of dozens to hundreds of log-likelihood units for most data sets. LG4X obtains substantial gains compared with LG4M, thanks to its distribution-free scheme for site rates. Since LG4M and LG4X display such advantages but require the same memory space and have comparable running times to standard models, we believe that LG4M and LG4X are relevant alternatives to single replacement matrices.

An Improved LEACH Routing Protocol for Energy-Efficiency of Wireless Sensor Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2225/,"Nguyen, Duy TanLongzhe, HanNguyen, Dinh VietMinho, JoViệt Nguyễn Đình","A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network consisting of a base station (BS) and multiple micro-sensor nodes. The micro-sensor nodes run on batteries that are not recharged during the network’s lifetime. Therefore, prolonging WSN lifetime is a significant problem. There are some energy-efficient hierarchical routing protocols designed especially for WSNs, such as sensor protocols for information negotiation (SPIN), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) and LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C). In this article, we propose an improvement on the LEACH routing protocol to decrease energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. LEACH-Distance Energy (LEACH-DE) selects a cluster head node not only by considering residual energy of the node greater than the average residual energy level of nodes in network, but also by examining the geometric distance between the candidate node to the BS as a key parameter. The results of simulation show our proposed algorithm outperforms LEACH and LEACH-C in terms of conserving energy and prolonging WSN lifetime.",Article,Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2012
A Maximum Likelihood Method for Detecting Bad Samples from Illumina BeadChips Data,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/106/,"Nguyen, Ha Anh TuanLe, Sy VinhLe, Si QuangProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","Genotype data provide crucial information to understand effects of genetic variation to human health. Current microarray technologies are able to generate raw genotype data from thousands of samples across million of SNP sites. These raw data are processed by computational methods, called genotype caller, to obtain genotypes. Genotype calls of different callers might not be consistent due to noise of bad samples or SNPs. This requires a manual quality control step conducted by experts to remove bad samples or bad SNP sites.

Building Distributed Attribute-Value Trees on DHT-based Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/115/,"Nguyen, Hoai-SonTan, YasuoShinoda, Y.Prof. Xuan-Tu Tran","Today, when a huge number of information resources appear in the Internet, one problem arising is how to search and exploit these information resources efficiently and flexibly with high scalability. We believe that the realization of multiple-attribute searching in a distributed manner is an important solution for this problem. In this paper, we propose a solution of building a distributed attribute-value tree (AV tree) on DHT-based networks to realize multiple-attribute searching. Each resource is named by an AV tree and DHT keys are created from each AV branch of a resource name. Resource information is distributed to a DHT-based network by the use of these DHT keys. Our solution keeps the locality of resource names in the key space of DHT networks such that AV branches that share a number of attribute/value pairs (AV pairs) will be mapped to a continuous portion of the key space. Therefore, multiple-attribute searching can be achieved efficiently by querying nodes responsible for a continuous portion of the key space. Our system can achieve both efficiency and a good degree of load balancing even when the distribution of AV pairs in resource names is skewed. Our simulation result shows the efficiency of our solution in respects of query success ratio and the degree of load balancing, comparing with conventional approaches.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Buildings;Indexes;Information services;Load management;Routing;Routing protocols;Search problems;Internet;cryptography;file organisation;information resources;query processing;trees (mathematics);AV tree;DHT-based networks;Internet;distributed attribute-value trees;information resources;multiple-attribute searching;query processing;DHT;Load balancing;Multiple Attribute/Value Searching;,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2012.98,"Information Technology (IT)

Experimental results on simulated and real data confirm that running times are greatly reduced when considering the above-mentioned optimization in comparison to the naïve rearrangement procedure.

Thiol molecules adsorption on gold surface was performed using thioglycolic acid (TGA, HS-CH2-COOH) monomers and a self-assembled technique. Characterization by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed gold–sulfur (Au–S) bonding through confirming the presence and disappearance of thiol molecules on the Au surface before and after the sample’s immersion in the TGA solution. Moreover, FTIR spectra also proved the presence of carboxyl molecules (C=O; OH) at the free end on the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface.

Thus, the problem turns out to be predicting the soft tissue thicknesses for any given skull. With the rapid development of the computer, different techniques are being used in the community for prediction tasks and in recent years the concept of neural networks has emerged as one of them. The principal strength of the neural network is its ability to find patterns and irregularities as well as detecting multi-dimensional non-linear connections in data. In this paper, we propose a method of applying neural networks to predict the soft tissue thicknesses for facial reconstruction. We use the distances between anthropometric locations at the skull as input, and the soft tissue thicknesses as output, as this format is suitable for many machine learning mechanisms.

Hybrid Contention-Based Geographic Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2375/,"Le, Dinh ThanhNguyen, Dai ThoHo, ThuanDr. Dai Tho Nguyen","Beaconless and contention-based geographic routing is an attractive approach to resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. Aggressive contention is the most cost-efficient form of contention-based geographic routing since it uses no control packet. Nevertheless, to avoid duplicated data packets, aggressive contention must set restriction on the contention area. Consequently, its packet delivery rate is limited. On the other hand, non-aggressive contention maximizes packet delivery rate by making use of full contention area. As the compensation, control packets have to be used and additional delay is introduced. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Contention-Based Geographic Routing (HCGR) - a protocol that takes full aggressive contention and uses non-aggressive contention for recovering aggressive contention from failure. If aggressive contention succeeds, non-aggressive contention is suppressed. In cases where aggressive contention fails, non-aggressive contention is taken place to deliver data packets. Thus, HCGR can maximize packet delivery rate while keeping its overheads reasonably low. We implement HCGR and single-form protocols in the network simulator ns-2, conduct extensive simulations and present simulation results.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications > Communications

Different approaches have been proposed to estimate amino acid substitution matrices since the time of Day Hoff in 1972. Currently, maximum likelihood approaches have been widely used to estimate popular matrices such as WAG, LG, FLU, etc. Although maximum likelihood approaches result in high quality matrices, they are slow and not applicable to very large datasets. The most time consuming step in estimating matrices is building phylogenetics trees from protein alignments. In this paper, we propose new methods to overcome the obstacle by splitting large alignments into small ones which still contain enough evolutionary information for estimating matrices. Experiments with both Pfam and FLU datasets showed that proposed methods were about three to nine times faster than the best current method while the quality of estimated matrices are nearly the same.

Verifying Java Object Invariants at Runtime,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/116/,"Nguyen, Thu TrangTruong, Ninh ThuanNguyen, Viet HaMs. Cam Le Tran Thi","An object invariant consisting of a set of properties that must hold for all instances of a class at any time is usually used in object-oriented design. However, verifying object invariants at runtime is always a challenging task in software verification. This paper proposes a method for verifying invariants of Java objects at runtime using AOP. Suppose that a software application is designed using UML models and its constraints are specified in OCL expressions, the software is then implemented, by default, using the UML design. They propose to construct verifiable aspects which are automatically generated from OCL constraints. These aspects can be woven into Java code to check whether object invariants are violated at runtime. Benefiting from AOP in separation of crosscutting concerns and weaving mechanisms, generated aspects can do the verification task whenever values of objects' attributes are changed. A Verification Aspect Generator (VAG) tool has been developed allowing the automatic generation of verifying aspects from the UML/OCL constraints.

Based on the original idea of optimal maintenance of a spanning tree (OMST), we improve this algorithm considerably and propose our multicast protocol, as well as implement it as an extension of simulator NS-2.

General amino acid substitution models have been estimated from large protein databases, however, they are not specific for influenza viruses. In previous study, we estimated the amino acid substitution model, FLU, for all influenza viruses. Experiments showed that FLU outperformed other models when analyzing influenza protein sequences. Influenza virus genomes consist of different protein types, which are different in both structures and evolutionary processes. Although FLU matrix is specific for influenza viruses, it is still not specific for influenza protein types. Since influenza viruses cause serious problems for both human health and social economics, it is worth to study them as specific as possible. In this paper, we used more than 27 million amino acids to estimate 11 protein type specific models for influenza viruses. Experiments showed that protein type specific models outperformed the FLU model, the best model for influenza viruses.

The framework focuses on solving two main challenges posed by these kinds of documents: 1) data sparseness and 2) synonyms/homonyms. The former leads to the lack of shared words and contexts among documents while the latter are big linguistic obstacles in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The underlying idea of the framework is that common hidden topics discovered from large external data sets (universal data sets), when included, can make short documents less sparse and more topic-oriented. Furthermore, hidden topics from universal data sets help handle unseen data better. The proposed framework can also be applied for different natural languages and data domains. We carefully evaluated the framework by carrying out two experiments for two important online applications (Web search result classification and matching/ranking for contextual advertising) with large-scale universal data sets and we achieved significant results.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

This make the on-chip communication become a critical issue and the conventional bus based communication using a single bus or a hierarchy of busses could not response to the communication requirements between the integrated IP cores because of their poor scalability with system size, their shared bandwidth between all the integrated IPs, and the energy efficiency requirements of final products. To overcome those problems, the Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has been proposed as a promising on-chip communication solution for designing complex systems, especially when the semiconductor technology turns into nanoscale era. However, the development of design and test methodologies for this new paradigm is a complicated and time consuming engineering process, concerning to not only hardware design issues but also network protocols matters. After a decade of research and development, the NoC designers still have to face many challenges to bring the paradigm to final industrial products. This talk will first give a brief introduction to the network-on-chip concept, and then addresses on main challenges in de-signing and testing the on-chip communication network well as the attached IP cores.

Towards scalable agent based web service systems,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/1769/,"Nguyen, Viet HaBui, The DuyVu, Quang DungNguyen, Thi Thu HienViet Ha Nguyen","The increasing development of the Internet requires highly scalable, available, and reliable web servers in order to provide rapid response and high throughput to requests from hundreds millions users occurring at any time. The disadvantage of old fashioned approach which uses single-alone web servers is the problem of bottle-neck and overload on the server side as well as many additional problems for the network such as network traffic and routing overload. The load balancing problem of web servers can be solved with replicated web servers. However, the problems on the network are still left out. In this paper, we propose a framework to reallocate jobs from web servers to proxy servers that are close to the clients. By delivering certain jobs from requested web servers to designated proxy servers with mobile agents and executing these jobs at the proxy servers, our approach can reduce the load for web servers as well as reduce the traffic for the overall network.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5488620,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2010

Often, fast acquisition is achieved using parallel imaging (pMRI) techniques. It has been shown recently that the combination of pMRI and compressed sensing (CS), which enables exact reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals from a small number of random measurements, can accelerate the speed of MRI acquisition because the number of measurements are much smaller than that by pMRI per se. Also recently in CS, chaos filters were designed to obtain chaotic measurements. This chaotic CS approach potentially offers simpler hardware implementation. In this paper, we combine chaotic CS and pMRI. However, instead of using chaos filters, the measurements are obtained by chaotically undersampling the k-space. MRI image reconstruction is then performed by using nonlinear conjugate gradient optimization. For pMRI, we use the well-known approach SENSE - sensitivity encoding -, which requires an estimation of the sensitivity maps. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using the point spread function, the transform point spread function, and the reconstruction error measure.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Electronics and Communications

Although several general amino acid substitution models have been estimated from large protein databases, they might not be appropriate for analyzing specific species. In this paper, we apply the maximum likelihood approach to all influenza protein sequences to estimate an amino acid substitution model of so-called I09 for influenza viruses. Comparing I09 with fourteen other widely used models, we achieve remarkable results: (1) a likelihood improvement of phylogenetic trees based on I09 compared with other models. Precisely, I09 results in the best likelihood in 436 out of 489 cases tested; (2) tree topologies constructed with I09 and other models are frequently different indicating that the impact of I09 is not only on the likelihood improvement but also in tree topologies; (3) marked differences between I09 and other models revealing that existing models are not be able to capture the amino acid substitution process of influenza viruses.",Conference or Workshop Item (Speech),"biology computing, influenza-specific amino acid substitution model, maximum likelihood approach, maximum likelihood estimation, phylogenetic trees, protein databases, protein phylogenetic analysis, protein sequence alignment, protein sequence comparative systems, protein sequence similarity searching, Proteins, tree topologies, trees (mathematics)",,Information Technology (IT),2009

M.Prof. Xuan-Tu Tran",The novel design of a sensing microgripper based on silicon-polymer electrothermal actuators and piezoresistive force-sensing cantilever beams is presented. The actuator consists of a silicon comb structure with an aluminum heater on top and filled polymer in between the comb fingers. The sensor consists of a silicon cantilever with sensing piezoresistors on top. A microgripper jaw displacement up to 32 mum at a 4.5-V applied voltage is measured. The maximum average temperature change is 176 \textsuperscriptdegC. The output voltage of the piezoresistive sensing cantilever is up to 49 mV at the maximum jaw displacement. The measured force sensitivity is up to 1.7 V/N with a corresponding displacement sensitivity of 1.5 kV/m. Minimum detectable displacement of 1 nm and minimum detectable force of 770 nN are estimated. This sensing microgripper can potentially be used in automatic manipulation systems in microassembly and microrobotics. 2008-0064.,Article,"Electronics and Communications

It affects directly on the accuracy of many other problems such as Syntax Parsing, WordSense Disambiguation, and Machine Translation. Stochastic models solve this problem relatively well, but they still make mistakes. Transformation-based learning (TBL) is a solution which can be used to improve stochastic taggers by learning a set of transformation rules. However, its rule learning algorithm has the disadvantages that rule templates must be prepared by hand and only rules are instances of rule templates can be generated. In this paper, we propose a model to learn transformation rules without rule templates. This model considers the rule learning problem as a feature selection problem.

Recognizing Postures in Vietnamese Sign Language With MEMS Accelerometers,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/201/,"Bui, The DuyNguyen, Thang LongProf. Xuan-Tu Tran","In this paper, we discuss the application of microelectronic mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometers for recognizing postures in Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL). We develop a similar device to the Accele Glove for the recognition of VSL. In addition to the five sensors as in the Accele Glove, we placed one more sensor on the back of the hand to improve the recognition process. In addition, we use a completely different method for the classification process leading to very promising results. This paper concentrates on signing with postures, in which the user spells each word with finger signs corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Therefore, we focus on the recognition of postures that represent the 23 Vietnamese-based letters together with two postures for ``space'' and ``punctuation''. The data obtained from the sensing device is transformed to relative angles between fingers and the palm. Each character is recognized by a fuzzy rule-based classification system, which allows the concept of vagueness in recognition. In addition, a set of Vietnamese spelling rules has been applied to improve the classification results. The recognition rate is high even when the postures are not performed perfectly, e.g., the finger is not bended completely or the palm is not straight",Article,Accelerometers;Application software;Character recognition;Fingers;Handicapped aids;Mechanical sensors;Mechanical systems;Microelectronics;Micromechanical devices;Shape;accelerometers;biocommunications;fuzzy systems;gesture recognition;handicapped aids;knowledge based systems;microsensors;natural language processing;pattern classification;MEMS accelerometers;Vietnamese sign language;Vietnamese spelling rules;Vietnamese-based letters;finger signs;fuzzy rule-based classification system;microelectronic mechanical system accelerometers;posture recognition;Human computer interaction;Vietnamese sign language (VSL);microelectronic mechanical system (MEMS) sensors;sign language recognition;,,"Electronics and Communications

However, there are existing errors in the accelerometer and gyroscope signals that cause unacceptable drifts. There are two kinds of noise in the INS: deterministic and stochastic errors. The deterministic noises are usually eliminated by the carefully calibration process but the stochastic noises are always difficult to treat. In this paper, we have determined successfully the characteristics of the MEMS sensor' noise by analyzing the Allan variance of the experiment data. After characterizing the IMU errors, the information of these noise is brought to the Wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis (WMRA) block in order to improve the sensors' SNR, remove sensor errors that are mixed with motion dynamics, and provide more reliable data that is applied directly to the noise eliminating block (NEB)",Article,"Electronics and Communications

One of the challenges for asynchronous NoC-based systems design is testing asynchronous network architectures for manufacturing defects. To improve the testability of asynchronous NoCs, we have developed a scalable and configurable asynchronous Design-for-Test (DfT) architecture. In this architecture, each asynchronous network node is surrounded by an asynchronous test wrapper and the network communication channels are reused as a high-speed Test Access Mechanism (TAM). This architecture is designed to test all network elements (routers, communication channels), but it can also be used to test computational resources.

Towards building up an m-World,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2066/,"Ngo, Le MinhNgô Lê Minh","The rapid development ofmobile computing has dramatically changed the way users view and use computers. With mobile computing technologies, we can acquire, deliver and process information at every place. Appearing in many forms such as the PalmOS, Pocket PC and Mobile Phone with increasingly diverse functions, and equipped with advanced peripheral devices such as GPS, camera and wireless adapter, mobile devices is becoming a very powerful all-in-one Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). PDAs have increased the effectiveness, brought people closer and made people more dynamic and flexible. In this paper, we present our research on setting up an m-World with various activities on PDAs. Our research focuses on three categories: education activities (mlearning), commerce activities (m-commerce) and service activities (m-service). In the first category, we have built a PDA-based m-learning system which allows the students to access the learning resources and allows the students and lecturers to exchange ideas from anywhere and at any time. In the category of commerce activities, we have developed experimental system which allows the user to do his/her shopping with mobile phones. There are various of systems which we have developed in the category of service activities including tourist assistant and traffic jam warning system. Our initial results have shown that such an m-World we are looking forward to is not very far from real.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2066/1/Towards%20building%20up%20an%20m-World.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2006
The impact of the implosion problem on the backoff time for a reliable multicast protocol,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2064/,"Ngo, Le MinhNgô Lê Minh",This paper studies the implosion problem in multicast. The result explained in this paper is a part of the work on analyzing the scalability of a reliable multicast protocol. The paper describes a method proposed to determine the backoff time for multicast clients to avoid packet loss due to the implosion problem. The proposed method has been implemented and the output data is shown. The flow of acknowledgment packets from clients to the server has been studied. Random multicast networks are generated and backoff times are calculated in order to show the impact of the implosion problem on the transmission delay in reliable multicast. It is proved by analysis that the backoff interval is proportional to the number of users which is large enough. Linear increase in transmission delay is equivalent to that a reliable multicast protocol fails to work for a large number of users.,Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2064/1/backoffmulticast-rivf06.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2006

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF ROUTING PROTOCOLS AND INTERNET ACCESS IN MULTI-HOP MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKS,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2988/,"Nguyen, Manh HaNguyen, Dinh VietViệt Nguyễn Đình","A multi-hop mobile ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes dynamically forming a temporary network without the usage of any existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. They are self-organized and used in disaster relief, conference, and battlefield environments where infrastructure had been destroyed or does not exist. Because of the unpredictable dynamically moving nature of mobile nodes, the overhead of routing traffic in an ad hoc network is likely to be higher than that in a wire-line network. Consequently,routing protocol have been playing crucial role in the efficiency of overall network operation. There are numerous proposals have been submitted, however many aspects of them needed more investigation and evaluation especially performance and QoS. In this paper, we will evaluate recent development in ad hoc network routing protocols and gateway discovery for Internet access within data intensive environment as well as present quantitative analysis base on simulation by ns-2 network simulator.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2006

Chúng tôi cũng thực hiện các mô phỏng hàng đợi kiểu Tail-Drop để so sánh với RED.

To ameliorate these burdens, web caching, a technology that hold any retrieved object can reduce network, server load and the latency of response substantially. However, there is a serious disadvantage that the object returned to client by cache maybe stale and inconsistence with the one on server. This paper discusses several caching algorithms and architectures to limit the degree of staleness.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN TRANSPORT PROTOCOL FOR HIGH BANDWIDTH-DELAY NETWORKS,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2991/,"Nguyen, Manh HaNguyen, Dinh VietViệt Nguyễn Đình","The development of gigabit and satellite networking is driving TCP congestion control outside of its natural operating regime. The reason is that AIMD algorithm [2] provides poor utilization of the bottleneck link and long RTT flows are often unable to get a fair allocation of bottleneck bandwidth [3] in those kinds of network. Therefore, this topic is immediately becoming one of universal interests in network performance research community. However, it is difficult to estimate the demand and supply of network resources in dynamic network environment. Although many approaches are used, feedback-based scheme [1], [4] is still the most favorite and prospective one. Some implementations of this approach have been carried out but the detail performance comparison has not been known. This report discusses some advanced approaches and figures out the both advantages and disadvantages of each one; especially BIC-TCP, a new approach based on binary increase congestion control mechanism aimed to solve the TCP friendliness and bandwidth scalability problems. Finally, we inform a number of performance evaluations and parameters which will, in turn, be analyzed after in order to get a better result in various network environments based on ns-2 network simulator.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),2005

Certainly, the performance is the most desired issue. This paper presents our efforts in measuring and comparing the performance of ad hoc routing protocols by simulating with the use of NS2 (Network Simulator version 2) package.

Effects of nitrogen incorporation on structure of a-C:H films deposited on polycarbonate by plasma CVD,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2919/,"Nguyễn, Cường/ KiênTahara, M.Yamauchi,, N.Sone, T.Assoc.Prof Cuong / Kien NGUYEN","Nitrogen-incorporated-hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H:N) films were deposited on polycarbonate (PC) substrates by r.f. plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Effects of nitrogen incorporation on microstructure, bonding states, chemical composition, internal stresses, and friction coefficients of deposited films were investigated. The films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron microscopy, infrared microscopy (IR), Raman spectroscopy and friction tests. Results from the measurement indicate that incorporated nitrogen content has considerable effects on film properties. Raman spectra of the a-C:H:N films are broad, asymmetric and centered at around wavenumber of 1500 cm-1. Shifting of the G-peak toward the higher wavenumber, narrower bandwidth of the G-peak and an increase of the ID/IG ratio demonstrate the graphitic character of the a-C:H:N films with the further increase of the atomic fraction of nitrogen (N/C). IR spectra demonstrate nitrogen bonded to carbon and hydrogen as CZN, CMN, N–H and C–H bonding configurations in the aC:H:N films. The internal stress considerably decreased as well as the friction coefficient is low when the N/C fraction increased. The surface roughness of the a-C:H:N films estimated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) seems to be less smooth with the increase in the N/C fraction.

The underlying idea of the proposed blind source separation (BSS) method is based on the observation that a monocomponent FM signal is represented by a linear feature corresponding to the 'energy concentration points' in the time-frequency (TF) image. Therefore, we propose to adapt an existing 'road network extraction' method Tupin et al., (1998) for the detection and separation of the source signal components from the spatially averaged TF image of their mixtures. The sources spatial signatures are then used to group together (classify) the components of the same source (or equivalently, the same spatial direction).

A Way to Estimate TCP Throughput under Low-Rate DDoS Attacks: One TCP Flow,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3999/,"Kieu, Minh VietNguyen, Dai ThoNguyen, Thanh ThuyDr. Dai Tho Nguyen","TCP-targeted low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) attacks were first introduced by A. Kuzmanovic and E. Knightly in 2003. The authors also proposed a simple model to quantify TCP throughput under LDDoS attacks. Since then, there have been many researchers attemping to estimate the throughput, such as Luo et al. We agree with them upon the sketch of TCP congestion window under a successful LDDoS attack but we find out that there are more cases than what has been specified. Moreover, the relative error of Luo’s estimation method is still high. Our goal in this paper is to propose a simple but more accurate method to estimate TCP throughput of a single TCP flow under such DDoS attacks. Our estimation values in various scenarios are compared with the results of simulations performed with NS-2 simulator, so that the effectiveness of our method is illustrated.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/3999/1/pdf.pdf,"Advanced Insitute of Engineering and Technology (AVITECH)

Simulation-based Evaluation of Performance of a Snoop TCP Scheme over Networks with Wireless Links,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2227/,"Nguyen, Dinh VietViệt Nguyễn Đình","TCP is a transport protocol designed and tuned to work well in fixed networks, however TCP performance is degraded severely in a network with wireless links. To enhance TCP performance in such networks, some proposals have been made in the last several years. Among them Snoop TCP proposal is one of the most important ones. Our paper investigates the effect of various error rates of wireless link on the performance of snoop TCP; normal TCP is also put to our investigation to make a comparison. We use the network simulator ns-2, version 2.1b9 extensively.

TCP Enhancements and Performance over Networks with Wireless Links,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2229/,"Nguyen, Dinh VietViệt Nguyễn Đình","Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses end-to-end flow, congestion, and error control mechanisms to provide reliable delivery over the Internet. During many years of extensive use in inter-networks, all weak-points of TCP are discovered and tuned, so that it performs very well in traditional network (wired network). However, inter-networks growth explosively and may consist of networks with wireless links characterized by high and sporadic bit error rate and intermittent connectivity due to handoff. TCP performance is degraded severely in such networks. Many studies have been carrying out to improve the performance of TCP in networks with wireless links. Some solutions are proposed and implemented.

Về hệ mã mật khoá công khai,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/2996/,"Nguyen, Dinh VietViệt Nguyễn Đình","At present, most of information resources are on computer's memory, and computers communicate with each other via computer networks. Those communication channels are insecure in the sense that, when a sender A sends a message to receiver B, an enemy could receive the message physically. The most important role of a cryptosystem is to make the enemy unable to know the content of the message - to guarantee the Secrety and the Authenticity of information. The cryptosystems based on symmetric algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption process, so the key must be kept secret. A sender and a receiver have to agree about the secret key before communication or have to use a secure channel to send secret key from the sender to the receiver. It is a matter of fact that it is not always possible. The cryptosystems based on asymmetric algorithms use one key - KB for encryption and another key - kB for decryption. A Key generator generates a pair (KB, kB) basing on the initial conditions. When B wants to send A a message, he/she uses Key generator to generate a pair (KB, kB) then sends KB (it is called Public-Key) to A, so A can use it to encrypt the message. When receiving encrypted message, B uses the secret key kB to decrypt it. The asymmetric cryptosystems must guarantee that, if the enemy receives the encrypted message and the key KB associated with it, it is not practically possible for him to calculate the secret key kB to decrypt the message. In other word, that is an intractable problem for him. The name Public-Key comes from that sense.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),1998
Towards Robust Cognitive 3D Brain-inspired Cross-paradigm System,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4456/,"Abdallah, Abderazek BenDang, Nam KhanhKhanh N. Dang","Spiking Neuromorphic systems have been introduced as promising platforms for energy-efficient spiking neural network (SNNs) execution. SNNs incorporate neuronal and synaptic states in addition to the variant time scale into their computational model. Since each neuron in these networks is connected to many others, high bandwidth is required. Moreover, since the spike times are used to encode information in SNN, a precise communication latency is also needed, although SNN is tolerant to the spike delay variation in some limits when it is seen as a whole. The two-dimensional packet-switched network-on-chip was proposed as a solution to provide a scalable interconnect fabric in large-scale spike-based neural networks. The 3D-ICs have also attracted a lot of attention as a potential solution to resolve the interconnect bottleneck. Combining these two emerging technologies provides a new horizon for IC design to satisfy the high requirements of low power and small footprint in emerging AI applications. Moreover, although fault-tolerance is a natural feature of biological systems, integrating many computation and memory units into neuromorphic chips confronts the reliability issue, where a defective part can affect the overall system's performance. This paper presents R-NASH - a reliable three-dimensional digital neuromorphic system geared explicitly toward the 3D-ICs biological brain's three-dimensional structure, where information in the network is represented by sparse patterns of spike timing and learning is based on the local spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule. Our platform enables high integration density and small spike delay of spiking networks and features a scalable design. R-NASH is a design based on the Through-Silicon-Via technology, facilitating spiking neural network implementation on clustered neurons based on Network-on-Chip. We provide a memory interface with the host CPU, allowing for online training and inference of spiking neural networks. Moreover, R-NASH supports fault recovery with graceful performance degradation.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

In the view of information and communications technology, five major cases, including smart-crop monitoring, drone farming, smart-livestock monitoring, autonomous farming machinery, and smart-building and -equipment management have the potential to radically transform many aspects of agriculture. However, the establishment of digital tools used in smart agriculture programs has been still lacking. Of our interest, we reported two out of many cases of Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based tools for the research in agriculture. In the first case, we investigated an electronic trap for automated monitoring of fall armyworm (FAW). Briefly, FAW (Spodoptera frugiperda) has been reported as one of the most devastating pests that can attack maize (Zea mays) at all growth stages. Since the first occurrence of FAW in Vietnam has been reported in 2019, this lepidopteran pest had caused huge damage to maize production in the Northern provinces of Vietnam. Thus, monitoring, identification, and management of FAW in the fields become one critical task for sustainable agricultural production. As the result, we introduced an automated FAW (adult moths) counting system based on the traditional pheromone traps. The IoT sensors have been merged into the instrument to count the frequency of adult moths and together record the temperature and humidity data. The general data, including the real-time amount of trapped insects and environmental conditions, has been analyzed based on the machine-learning method, consequently, send to the Internet browser and applications. In the second case, we constructed a cost-effective phenotyping machine for automated seed imaging. Particularly, agronomists have an issue with the estimation of various typical characteristics of seeds, like length, width, mass, the color of the skin, and pubescence. By using the computer vision approach, we generated an easy-to-use tool for automatically measuring the general features of crop seeds. The construction of this tool can significantly replace labors with only simple operations. Taken together, our tools could significantly provide a collection of digital tools for supporting the digital transformation in research and development in the agriculture sector.",Conference or Workshop Item (Speech),Agriculture Technology,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4696/1/ky-yeu-ht_2.pdf,Faculty of Agriculture Technology (FAT),Not Specified

Unlike common approaches in the time domain, a recent effective algorithm using the Upscale and Downscale Representation (UDR) technique has been introduced to process the signal in the image domain. The idea of UDR is to visualize the input with an appropriate line width, convert it to a binary image, and then smooth it by skeletonizing the signal object to a unit width and projecting it back to the time domain. We propose in this paper a cascaded UDR (CUDR) where the interested signal is filtered twice. CUDR’s performance is verified on simulated data with added white Gaussian noise and compared with the cascaded arrangement of some conventional techniques. Experimental results have demonstrated the outperformance of CUDR in terms of the fitting error when dealing with noisy signals, especially at a low signal-to-noise ratio.",Article,"Electronics and Communications > Electronics and Computer Engineering

The optimization of water allocation for agriculture requires soil moisture monitoring. Recent studies suggested to take advantage of continuously emitted navigation signals by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations, to retrieve soil moisture variations. This active remote sensing technique, known as GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R), consists in comparing the interference of reflected waves by the ground and those which come directly from satellites. It offers a wide range of applications in Earth sciences and particularly in soil moisture monitoring, this technique has shown their efficiency for soil with high clay content. It namely presents the advantage of sensing a whole surface around a reference GNSS antenna. In this article, we focus on soil moisture monitoring of sandy areas. The study site is a beach volley field, located in the Paul Sabatier University campus in Toulouse, France, the soil contains 100% of sand. We demonstrated that the waves of the GNSS signals penetrate deeply into the soil and reduce the interest of GNSS-R surface moisture measurements. However, it is possible to retrieve a correct estimate of the soil moisture at 0.1m depth and to obtain a very good temporal monitoring with the benefit of a spatial resolution directly correlated to the antenna height.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Aerospace Engineering

However, due to the computation complexity of the attention operation, these models are not applicable to dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic-GTN model which is designed to learn the node embedding in a continous-time dynamic graph. The Dynamic-GTN extends the attention mechanism in a standard GTN to include temporal information of recent node interaction. Based on temporal patterns interaction between nodes, an node sampling step is added to reduce the number of attention connections in the dynamic graph. We evaluate our model on three benchmark datasets for learning node embedding in dynamic graphs.

However, little information is available on the SWEET family in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The objectives of this present study were to genome-wide identify and characterize the BvSWEET family in sugar beet. Materials and Methods: Based on the available genome, proteome and transcriptome databases of sugar beet, various computational tools have been used to analyze the nucleotide and full-length protein sequences of members of the BvSWEET family. Results: A total of 16 members of the BvSWEET family has been identified in sugar beet at the genome-wide scale. Structural analysis indicated that the BvSWEET family exhibited variable characteristics. Furthermore, the BvSWEET family in sugar beet could be categorized into four distinct groups like in other plant species. Of our interest, we found that some BvSWEET genes exhibited strongly preferential expression in major organs/tissues under adverse environmental stimuli.

This activity becomes even much more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to the variability of failures in SPL systems. These unexpected behaviors are caused by variability faults which can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. Although localizing bugs in non-configurable code has been investigated in-depth, variability fault localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. To approach this challenge, we propose a benchmark for variability fault localization with a large set of 1,773 buggy versions of six SPL systems and baseline variability fault localization performance results.

By analyzing and evaluating the affection of the proposed protocol using the Cooja tool in the Contiki operating system, we estimated the consumed battery energy of sensor nodes in WSNs and proved that our CL-RPL protocol can support the system performances bet-ter than the previous original RPL protocol in terms of network lifetime and packet delivery ratio.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Electronics and Communications > Communications,,Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications (FET),Not Specified

Evaluation of Biological Traits and Bioactive Compounds in Several Spinach Varieties (Spinacia oleracea L.) Grown inaVertical Hydroponic System,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4820/,"Nguyen, K.L.Nguyá»�n LÃª Khanh","The implementationof breeding programsfor indoor vertical farms has been increasingto provide new varieties that have higher nutritional contentsand morphological traits fitted to thesesustainable production systems. Spinach (Spinacia oleraceaL.) is one of the fastest-growing, nutrient-dense leafy vegetables to grow indoors. In Vietnam, market demand for spinach is growing together with the expansion of soilless cultivation technologies such as hydroponics and vertical farming. This research aimed to evaluate the growth parameters, initially screening the relationship between yield and biological traits,of 12 spinach varieties. In addition, this research also aimed to evaluate the lutein, vitamin C, total flavonoid,and carbohydrate contentsin different varieties of spinach and theircorrelationswith morphological traits. The research outcomesrevealed significant positive correlations between plant weight and leaf area. Three spinach varieties belonging to the smooth leaf type (“AD”, “CH”,and“DT”)were the top three yielding under low light conditions. There were significant differences in the lutein content among varieties. “Red” and “Mikado” werethetwo highest varieties for lutein content. Vitamin C and total flavonoid contentswere statistically similar in the tested varieties, while the carbohydrate content was slightly different among them. This research firstly suggested better suited spinach varieties to be grown in vertical farmingconditions, and secondly, providedbreeders information on trait identifications to prepare breeding materials for vertical farms.",Article,Agriculture Technology,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4820/1/document.pdf,Faculty of Agriculture Technology (FAT),Not Specified
Effects of Led Light Intensityand Carbon Dioxide Concentration on the Growthof Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) in a Plant Factory,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4821/,"Nguyen, K.L.Pham, Chau ThuyNguyá»�n LÃª Khanh","In this study, the effects of light intensity and the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on spinach’s growth during vegetative stage in a plant factory (PF)was investigated. Twoexperiments were conducted with different CO2concentration in closed chamber (500 ppm and 800 ppm). In each experiment, plants were hydroponically grown under three light intensities of L1:115 μmol.m-2s-1, L2: 140 μmol.m-2s-1and L3: 160 μmol.m-2s-1. Growth’s parameters were determined at different growth stages (T30, T37 and T44 respectively to 30, 37 and 44 days after sowing). The results showed that, before 30 days old, the increase of light intensity was not significantly effected to the growth of plant. During later growing periods (30 days old afterward), the increase of light intensity remarkably boost up yield’s related traits such as leaf number, fresh mass and dry mass under 500ppm CO2concentration. At T37, fresh weigh increased 2.1 and2.4 times when increasing light intensity from L1 to L2 and from L1 to L3, respectively.The combination of light intensity and CO2concentration at 800ppm showed the plant growth indicators increased significantly at the T37 and T44 stages (after 30 days old), especially atthe last week of growth period, fresh weight and dry weight of plants were significantly different at the light treatment L2, increased 37.5% and 57.6%, respectively as compared to light treament only. The results suggested that, during latest growing period, the average light intensity of140 μmol.m-2s-1combining with elevating CO2concentration is an alternatively way to enhance spinach growth. The findings of this study could be helpful for growers to improve growthconditions fora better development of spinach in the indoor farming (PF).",Article,Agriculture Technology,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4821/1/document-2.pdf,"Center for Electronics and Telecommunications Research (CETR)

In this Part II, emerging technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges (e.g., privacy-preserving, scheduling, and incentive mechanisms) in implementing social distancing in practice. As an example, instead of reacting with ad-hoc responses to COVID-19-like pandemics in the future, smart infrastructures (e.g., next-generation wireless systems like 6G, smart home/building, smart city, intelligent transportation systems) should incorporate a pandemic mode in their standard architectures/designs.",Article,"Electronics and Communications

A Variability Fault Localization Approach for Software Product Lines,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4619/,"Nguyen, Thu TrangNgo, Kien TuanNguyen, Van SonVo, Dinh HieuDr Vo Dinh Hieu","Software fault localization is one of the most expensive, tedious, and time-consuming activities in program debugging. This activity becomes even much more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to variability of failures. These unexpected behaviors are induced by variability faults which can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. The interaction among these features causes the failures of the system. Although localizing bugs in single-system engineering has been studied in-depth, variability fault localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. In this article, we present VarCop, a novel and effective variability fault localization approach. For an SPL system failed by variability bugs, VarCop isolates suspicious code statements by analyzing the overall test results of the sampled products and their source code. The isolated suspicious statements are the statements related to the interaction among the features which are necessary for the visibility of the bugs in the system. In VarCop, the suspiciousness of each isolated statement is assessed based on both the overall test results of the products containing the statement as well as the detailed results of the test cases executed by the statement in these products. On a large public dataset of buggy SPL systems, our empirical evaluation shows that VarCop significantly improves two state-of-the-art fault localization techniques by 33% and 50% in ranking the incorrect statements in the systems containing a single bug each. In about two-thirds of the cases, VarCop correctly ranks the buggy statements at the top-3 positions in the resulting lists. Moreover, for the cases containing multiple bugs, VarCop outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches 2 times and 10 times in the proportion of bugs localized at the top-1 positions. Especially, in 22% and 65% of the buggy versions, VarCop correctly ranks at least one bug in a system at the top-1 and top-5 positions.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Near-isogenic lines of soybean confirm a QTL for seed waterlogging tolerance at different temperatures,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4460/,"Nguyen, Van LocDang, Thi Thu HienChu, Duc haTetsuhiro, NakamuraAbiko, TomomiToshihiro, MochizukiPh.D. Ha Chu","Climate change is predicted to increase the probability of soil waterlogging due to severe rainfall, causing significant damage to soybean at the germi�nation stage. Germination under waterlogging is also greatly influenced by temperature. To clarify the variation in germination responses of soybean geno�types to waterlogging at different temperatures, the seeds of 15 soybean genotypes were treated by soaking for 2 days at four temperatures: 21 �C, 23 �C, 25 �C, 27 �C and 29 �C. Differences in the germination rate (GR) and normal seedling rate (NSR)were observed among soybean genotypes after soak�ing treatments regardless of the temperature. Among the examined genotypes, Iyodaizu was classified as waterlogging tolerant at the germination stage, and Tachinagaha was classified as sensitive. Interestingly, through the analyses of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between Tachinagaha and Iyodaizu, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for root development under hypoxia at the seedling stage of soybean were detected on chromosome 12 (Chr.12).We investigated whether the candidate QTL region for root development is involved in seed waterlogging tolerance by using a near-isogenic line (NIL), NIL-9-4-5. Interestingly, under soaking treat�ment, the GR and NSR of NIL-9-4-5, carrying the candidate QTL region, was nearly the same as that of Iyodaizu and was significantly higher than that of Tachinagaha. These results may indicate that the candidate QTL region for root development under hypoxia at the seedling stage located on Chr.12 contributes to the seed waterlogging tolerance of soybean plants at the germination stage.",Article,ISI-indexed journals,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4460/1/2021.1%20%5BEuphytica%5D%20NIL%20SOybean%20flooding.pdf,Faculty of Agriculture Technology (FAT),Not Specified
A model for building probabilistic knowledge-based systems using divergence distances,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4288/,"Nguyen, Van ThamNguyen, Ngoc ThanhTran, Trong HieuDr. Trọng Hiếu Trần","The knowledge-based systems (KBSs) in general and solving the knowledge merging problem in particular have seen a great surge of research activity in recent years. However, there still exist two main shortcomings that need to be addressed in the probabilistic framework. Firstly, the current methods only deal with the problems in which original probabilistic knowledge bases (PKBs) are required to be consistent and formed in the same structure. It is a very strong requirement and difficult to apply in practice. Secondly, only a few measures of distance between probability distributions have been studied to apply in existing models. To overcome these disadvantages, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework for merging PKBs. To this end, a theoretical model is introduced and several experiments are implemented. In theoretical model, some theorems are pointed out and proved to provide mathematical background to construct the merging model. Moreover, a deep survey on how to employ divergence distance functions (DDFs) between probability distributions to carry out the merging process are performed. In experimental aspect, a consistency recovery algorithm and some merging algorithms based on DDFs are proposed. Through the results of conducted experiments, issues about the time cost of merging process, the number of iterations, and CPU Time Elapsed parameter to solve the class of optimization problems in the merging process are analyzed, compared, and evaluated.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

A model to detect student’s learning styles in the blended learning course,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4749/,"Nguyen, Viet AnhViet Anh Nguyen","Recently, personalized learning is becoming more and more popular, especially in blended learning courses. The student learning style is one of several factors to personalize content and appropriate learning activities for each learner. This article proposes a model to detect learning styles in blended learning courses to classify learners for personalization. The proposed model focuses on two phases: the online and face-to-face learning phases of the learning process. Besides, we also present several parameters to map resources and activities in a blended-learning course to a learning style model. Based on the identified criteria, the experimental results with 205 students' data when classifying learning styles by the Support Vector Machine method give an accuracy of 76.7% - 83.2% in the 04 dimensions of the Felder and Silverman model. Experimental results when applying two approaches: literature-based and driven-based, show that learners' styles are similar up to 83%. Findings show that the student's learning style does not change much in the learning process. As for course design implications, we also propose suggestions for developing content and designing learning activities.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),"Information Technology (IT)

Simulation-based invariant verification technique for the OTS/CafeOBJ method,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4565/,"Tran Dinh, DuongBui Duy, DangOgata, KazuhiroTran Dinh Duong","We demonstrate the power of the simulation-based invariant verification technique through two case studies in which it is formally verified that two mutual exclusion protocols, MCS protocol and Anderson protocol, enjoy the mutual exclusion property by the simulation-based invariant verification technique. We initially attempted formally verifying that the two protocols enjoy the property by the induction-based invariant verification technique. We successfully completed the formal proof for MCS protocol by the simulation-based invariant verification technique earlier than the one by the induction- based invariant verification technique even though we started the latter earlier than the former. We did not successfully complete the formal proof for Anderson protocol by the induction-based invariant verification technique as of the time of this paper submission. We define a variant of simulation, ""observably equivalent simulations,"" and prove some theorems on them to conduct the MCS case study. Given a state machine M, another state machine M' constructed by introducing auxiliary variables into M observably equivalently simulates M. In this sense, M' can be regarded as an abstract version of M.",Article,"Information Technology (IT)

Formal specification and model checking of a recoverable wait-free version of MCS,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4566/,"Tran Dinh, DuongWaki, KentaroOgata, KazuhiroTran Dinh Duong","MCS is widely known as one of the most efficient and influential spinning lock mutual exclusion protocols. The protocol, however, only works under the assumption that processes do not crash while acquiring/releasing the lock or being in the critical section. Furthermore, the exit segment pseudo-code of MCS’s algorithm is not wait-free since a process releasing the lock needs to wait for the next process in the virtual queue to perform some steps. A new version of MCS has been proposed by S. Dhoked and N. Mittal such that the new version is wait-free and recoverable (i.e., if some processes crash, the protocol can recover and work normally). In this paper, we formally specify the recoverable wait-free version of MCS and conduct model checking to check whether the protocol enjoys the mutual exclusion property. Our experiments say that: (1) the property is not satisfied if crashes are allowed to occur without any restriction, (2) the protocol enjoys the property if crashes never happen at all, or (3) if crashes have not occurred recently. We also describe the challenge of how to formally specify dynamic memory allocation and present our solution to solve that problem.",Conference or Workshop Item (Paper),Information Technology (IT),,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),Not Specified

Tại Việt Nam, sự thiếu hụt về mặt cơ sở hạ tầng đã gây hạn chế cho việc tổng hợp số liệu về sự xuất hiện của quần thể sâu keo mùa thu trên đồng ruộng. Bài báo này giới thiệu về thiết bị đếm sâu keo mùa thu trưởng thành tự động và đưa ra cổng thông tin cung cấp số liệu cập nhật theo thời gian thực về diễn biến của sâu keo mùa thu tại các tỉnh phía Bắc. Cụ thể, thiết bị được thiết kế dựa trên bẫy sâu trưởng thành sử dụng pheromone. Các cảm biến được tích hợp vào thiết bị nhằm đếm số lượng sâu trưởng thành bị bẫy và thu thập thông số môi trường, bao gồm nhiệt độ và độ ẩm không khí. Trong điều kiện nhà lưới, thiết bị đếm sâu đã thể hiện tính hiệu quả trong việc bẫy sâu trưởng thành dựa vào pheronome và sự chính xác trong việc đếm sâu bị bẫy. Toàn bộ dữ liệu tại các vị trí đặt bẫy, bao gồm số lượng sâu bẫy theo thời gian thực và thông số môi trường được phân tích bằng công cụ học máy, từ đó cung cấp thông qua trình duyệt web và ứng dụng điện thoại.

N-tier machine learning-based architecture for DDoS attack detection,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4290/,"Vuong, Thi HongNguyen, Thi Cam VanHa, Quang ThuyHong Thi Vuong","Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a menace to network security that aims at exhausting the target networks with malicious traffic. With simple but powerful attack mechanisms, it introduces an immense threat to the current Internet community. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-tier architecture intrusion detection model based on a machine learning method that possibly detects DDoS attacks. We evaluate our model using the newly released dataset CICDDoS2019, which contains a comprehensive variety of DDoS attacks and address the gaps of the existing current datasets. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method is more efficient than other existing ones. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed model accurately recognize DDoS attacks outperforming the state-of-the-art by F1-score.",Article,Information Technology (IT),https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4290/1/DDos_2020.pdf,Faculty of Information Technology (FIT),Not Specified
Early SKIP mode decision for HEVC with Hierarchical coding structure,https://eprints.uet.vnu.edu.vn/eprints/id/eprint/4233/,"Xiem, Hoang VanMinh, Dinh BaoByeungwoo, JeonBao Minh Dinh","To meet real-time video communications, an investigation of early SKIP mode decisions is still important in many practical applications of High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) encoders. On the other hand, in most current state-of-the-art early SKIP mode decision methods, the temporal layer index (TId), which is commonly used in the hierarchical coding structure, has not been fully exploited. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel early SKIP mode decision method for a HEVC encoder using TId-based rate-distortion (RD) modeling. In the proposed method, two new SKIP mode-checking conditions were introduced based on statistical analysis on TId and the RD-cost correlation. The experimental results showed that the proposed early SKIP mode decision method outperformed the relevant state-of-the-art HEVC complexity reduction methods significantly, with an encoding time saving of approximately 47% while having a BD-rate loss of only 0.45%.",Article,"Electronics and Communications
